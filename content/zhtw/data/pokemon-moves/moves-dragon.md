# 龍屬性
Dragon Types are ferocious and fearsome. They rely on high-power attacks to quickly dispatch the foe. Dragon Pokémon  are  eager  to  fight,  easily  angered  and  don’t show mercy nor respect towards anyone.

They wish to defeat strong opponents, take over large lands, and covet anything they find precious.
Their attacks are very powerful and devastating.
