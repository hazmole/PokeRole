# 惡屬性
Dark Types prey on the weak. They rely on hindering the foe and fighting dirty. These Moves use tricks, lies and negative  feelings.  Dark  Pokémon  are  vicious  and  their Moves  very  dangerous.  They  love  it,  sometimes  being nasty is way more fun.

Dark Types always try to Battle while putting the foes at  a  complete  disadvantage.  Never  underestimate  the power of proper planning.
