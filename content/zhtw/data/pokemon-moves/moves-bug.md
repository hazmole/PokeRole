# 蟲屬性
Bug Moves add a sting to all your attacks. They rely on quick, low-power strikes with added effects and swarm tactics.  Some  Moves  can  call  more  Bug  Pokémon  to  prevent  the  foe  from  escaping  or  to  help  you  on  your actions. 
Bug Moves don’t try to play it safe, they usually go all-out offensive or don’t go at all. If you think these Pokémon  just want to bug you, take a good look, they may have a lot of friends.

**效果絕佳:**
惡, 草, 超能力

**效果不好:**
妖精, 格鬥, 火, 飛行, 幽靈, 鋼
