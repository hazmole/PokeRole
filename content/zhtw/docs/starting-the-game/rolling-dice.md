## 擲骰判定
Our lives are influenced by random factors all the time. 
Luck is a part of our lives, fortune can change our future and destiny is built on the results of our actions.

**In Pokémon: The Role Playing Game all variables are represented by six-sided dice.** These Dice are pretty easy to get and you can find them in almost any gaming store. You may even have some from your old board games!

**You will need to roll the dice to perform any action** you can imagine.

During the course of the story, your character will have to perform certain actions that are out of the ordinary. 

Now that you have seen the Attributes and Skills, it’s time to learn about how to use them.

**Unless it’s something simple, every Action roll is an ensemble of an Attribute and a Skill**. The total sum of the points your character has in those traits is the final dice pool for the action. 

**Roll those dice and every dice that comes up as 4, 5 or 6 counts as a success.**
**You might require 1, 2, 3 or more successes** from this roll **depending on the difficulty of the task.**

<tr><td> 1 </td><td align="left"> <u>麻煩</u>. 你很少會做這樣的事情。 </td></tr>
<tr><td> 2 </td><td align="left"> <u>有挑戰性</u>. 你在執行時會遭遇不少阻礙。 </td></tr>
<tr><td> 3 </td><td align="left"> <u>困難</u>. 這個情境陷你於巨大的劣勢之中。 </td></tr>
<tr><td> 4 </td><td align="left"> <u>瘋狂</u>. 僅僅嘗試去這麼做的想法都顯得無比荒謬。 </td></tr>
<tr><td> 5+ </td><td align="left"> <u>幾乎不可能</u>. 一切邏輯推論都表明這個行為是不可能的任務。 </td></tr>

{{< example >}}
Wilson is chasing a **Murkrow** who stole his Trainer bag.
**Murkrow** is slowed due to the bag's weight and thus not able to fly high enough.
This makes the task pretty easy and Willson's roll only needs 1 Success to get the thief.

Later that day, a **Honchkrow** comes and steals his bag (again!) since it is stronger, it's not being slowed down and Wilson's roll will need 3 successes. 
If he doesn't catch it on his first attempt and **Honchkrow** starts to fly higher, his roll will progresively increase in difficulty, until **Honchkrow** gets out of reach and flies away

### ⬛ 大失敗
What would happen if you try to get a 4 year-old to land a plane during an emergency? Probably nothing good.

Underperforming when attempting a task can bring catastrofic results. That is why if **you score a roll with less than 3 successes than required** you will not just fail to do the task, but **something bad will happen** at your Storyteller's discretion.
* Receiving Damage
* Damaging an ally
* Making the task completely impossible
* Getting an Status Ailment 
 ...or worse.

That means that tasks that are **Troublesome**, or **Challenging** can be attempted safely, but as soon as the difficulty becomes **Hard** the possibilities of suffering injury or having disastrous consequences are very real.

The farther your roll is to the required successes, the worse the outcome will be.
