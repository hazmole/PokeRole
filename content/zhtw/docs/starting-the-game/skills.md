## Skills and Extras
You will be needing **Skills** to make your adventure easier  and help you go through many situations. Your Pokémon can learn a few on their own, but you can also train them so they can grow stronger.

A  Skill  is  a  varied  compendium  of  applied  knowledge. 
They can cover a broad number of situations, **they don't have to be specific to a certain discipline .**

There are so many different skills in the world, that it is impossible to practice or master most of them. Although the most relevant are listed in the Character Sheets, you may learn anything you want, from farming to poetry or anything you can imagine. Use **EXTRA** skills to take note of any other Skill not listed by default.
Keep in mind that most **Pokémon will need a Trainer's instruction to learn Skills not listed on their character sheet**.

**Skills can only be rolled alongside an Attribute, never on their own.**

Each Skill Point will be a dice added to the roll whenever you need more than your natural physical, mental or social power to succeed.

Most Action Rolls require an: <b>Attribute + Skill</b>
Make combinations to get a dice pool that fits the action you are trying to do.

It is also worth noting that **you cannot have more points on a Skill than those allowed by your Rank**, you’ll need to train harder to be able to specialize further.
