## Happiness & Loyalty

These attributes will define your relationship with your Pokémon and are among the most valuable traits in the game since they determine how good is your relationship with your companions.

What’s the use of a strong Pokémon if it hates you and wants to run away?

It is common for trainers to have a hard time with a newly caught Pokémon, they might even be attacked by said Pokémon since for all they know this is just Round two. This kind of reaction depends on the situation in which the Pokémon was caught but also depends on the species and their nature. 

The best tip we can give you: Try to start with the right foot.

Happiness and Loyalty range from 0 to 5 points.

In the wild, a **Pokémon usually has 2 points on each**, but as soon as they are caught their life changes forever.

A good trainer must know how to deal with rough edges if he plans on building a relationship and hopefully, increase these two traits.

As soon as you catch a Pokémon, reduce their Loyalty by the same amount as the Pain penalization you inflicted on them. 
Yeah, that’s right. If you beat them to a pulp, don’t expect them to be happy about it.

When you catch a Pokémon, reduce their happiness to 0 points if they were caught against their will, to 1 if the battle against them was unfair (many vs. one, using items etc.) and keep it at 2 ifyou fought them in fair conditions.

**These two traits cannot be increased with the Ranking system. You will need to role play if you want to affect them both positively or negatively.**

While Happiness and Loyalty are not directly linked, **keeping your Pokémon happy is a good way to gain or increase its Loyalty.**

Role-Playing will be the key to increase both traits.

{{< notice trainer "訓練家小技巧" >}}
Aim to build a strong relationship with your Pokémon while it’s still at an un-evolved stage.
Creating bonds with Pokémon in later stages will be a lot harder.

### Happiness
This trait is all about being happy and comfortable. Most Pokémon are simple creatures, they want safety, food, stability and especially they want to feel useful.
Some Pokémon will rejoice in the comfort and luxuries of the human world, while others will disregard them.
Always try to provide the life they want.

### Loyalty
This trait reflects how much they are willing to do for you; from ignoring you completely to risking their lives to save you, a loyal Pokémon is your best friend in better or worst. Never underestimate the power of friendship.

Pokémon evolution may bring a power surge that makes them feel they don't need you as much anymore, so their Loyalty score may go down upon evolving. 

Evolution might strain the relationship you had with your Pokémon, making it feel as if it were a stranger.

When a Pokémon evolves, roll their Trainer's highest Social Attribute.
Score at least 2 Successes, or else the Loyalty of the Pokémon will go down 1 point.
