## 創作故事
現在是時候用一點轟轟烈烈的爆炸讓命運的列車脫軌了！角色們期待著遭遇生活中的冒險，而當他們出發去找麻煩時，他們將發現你早已準備就緒。
擔任說書人並創作故事其實沒有大家想像中的那麼困難。放輕鬆，盡情享受那些瘋狂點子帶來的樂趣。只要記住，你在這裡是為了確保大家都能玩得開心。

首先，和你的玩家們討論，詢問他們希望玩些什麼？他們對故事有什麼樣的期待？以及他們對於寶可夢世界有什麼樣看法。

你需要統整他們的看法，確保他們對於這個社會的運作有一個清晰的認知，對角色看待寶可夢和其他人們的態度能有所共識，從而扮演出活生生的角色。你可以在最後為此做一個簡單總結，確保大家都站在同一條線上。

**仔細傾聽玩家關注的事物，也適時表達自己的意見。**
記得，他們也有責任創造出有趣且能為故事做出貢獻的角色。

那些與其他玩家或說書人作對的人，就是沒有正確履行身為玩家所應盡的職責。
**確保沒有任何玩家創造了無法與他人結交朋友的角色。**

一旦大家都達成了共識，就可以準備開始了。

### 遊戲時間的長度
一場遊戲聚會的時間通常會持續 2 ~ 4 個小時。

考慮到在這個時間段內，玩家們通常只能完成 2 ~ 3 個過程被詳細描述的目標，並仍保有一些發展角色的扮演空間。戰鬥永遠不會是必要的；正常人不需要每天都為自己的小命奮戰，但他們仍然會遭遇各種麻煩、緊張、和危急的時刻。戰鬥最好被用作緊張嚴峻情境、或一連串壞決定所導致的劇情高潮。

**這個遊戲的重點是精彩的故事劇情，而不是惱人的戰鬥練等。**

### 講述故事的多種方式
取決於玩家們的目標不同，總是會有辦法讓講述故事的過程變得更加輕鬆。

這個遊戲有三種主要的說故事方式：

<div class="Frame">

#### 編年史
Some stories are too long to be told in one game session. A Chronicle is a grand adventure with one main plot and usually one recurring villain. This kind of story can get really epic and can take months of gaming sessions.
It was made a common belief that this kind of storytelling was the normal mode to play, however, it is not. 

This is hard mode.

It’s common to see people start a Chronicle and never finish it, so keep it simple.
Communication between players and storyteller makes all the difference.
</div>
<div class="Frame">

#### 單元劇
Picture it like watching a TV Show, a single session is a complete adventure on its own. 
Many things could change for better or worse, however, let it be powerful. Allow the players to learn something from it. The fact that they can 
return to their normal lives doesn’t mean they went home empty-handed.

It is possible to begin to play in an Episodic way and then throw some Chronicle elements.
</div>
<div class="Frame">

#### 環團
Storyteller Rotation has a great advantage due to many people taking turns at storytelling. 
The characters will be provided with many more kinds of adventures because everyone has a unique way of thinking. 

Storytellers may take a break and also play their characters and there’s more time to write better adventures.
It’s like watching a series of movies telling the comings and goings of the Characters. It is very similar to a normal Chronicle that is combined with Episodic Storytelling.

### 所有玩家都應該……
###### 順從故事的流動
<u>Stay in character and actively role-play</u>, so instead of saying: “I send out my dragon pokémon and I order it to attack or whatever...” Act as if your character was really in the situation and say: “Garchop, go! Charge using Dragon rush!” So don't be shy and let's have fun!

###### 保持專注
Sometimes not much is happening, or maybe your character is not on the scene. <u>Be calm, listen, and stay focused.</u> Paying attention when the storyteller is speaking is a common courtesy. It will make the game flow faster and smoother.

###### Work as a Team
The other players are members of your group, you should be friendly to them and their characters. <u>You guys are a team and should work as such.</u> Antagonizing other party members for your own amusement is disruptive and disrespectful. Don’t be THAT guy.

###### Request Goals
Are you trying to defeat the Gym leaders? Exploring old ruins full of strange Pokémon? Make characters to fit that goal. If for some reason you are at a loss of what to do, you should <u>ask the Storyteller</u> to do a retell on the important plot points.

###### Not obsess about rules and mechanics
Remember that the Storyteller will decide what’s appropriate in the story. If there is a conflict or a stalemate <u>use common sense</u> and prioritize the story flow over anything else.

###### Try out Storytelling!
Everyone has the ability to tell a story, we want to encourage you to try it from time to time.
<u>It’s a wonderful experience and it’s easier than you’d think.</u>
We’re sure you can do it!

## Laws of Storytelling
1. **Don’t create a story to win**
This is not about how you are going to defeat the players.

2. **Don’t fret over minuscule details**
Your job is to create a mood, an atmosphere. You don’t have to describe where every single object is. Let their imaginations do the work, this will save time and make the game flow uninterrupted.

3. **Help the players get into their characters**
Players are not really inside the Pokémon world. Don’t expect them to perform as you imagined. Try to tell them how their characters feel and what they are thinking. It’s useful to place thoughts in them from time to time.

4. **The game is not only about mechanics**
This game is about active role-playing, don’t get too deep into the numbers, the rules, and pop-up combat. It’s never as important as the drama.

5. **Actively Role-Play**
This game requires active role-playing. You are not only preparing to tell a story, you are also getting prepared for acting. The same law applies to the Players. Add spice by describing the actions and the Moves of their Characters and Pokémon in the game.

6. **Use tools**
Even if you have a beautiful voice, use appropriate music and sound effects. You may print maps or show your players pictures of the places they are in. This will help everyone to be in the same tune and will make your story a lot more interesting. 

7. **Get prepared**
It’s not ok to walk into the room not knowing what you are going to say. Improvisation can only take you so far.

8. **Use Time**
Use time in your favor. You can use Flashbacks, Fast-Forwards, or Pause the session if you need some time to think. Taking breaks is always nice.

9. **Make sure everyone is having fun**
You are not their entertainer, but you have to make sure everyone is taking part in the story. From the most talkativeand extrovert to the most shy and timid of your players.

10. **Start as close to the end as possible**
Long introductions are boring. Even If there is something very important from the past, try to use exposition to say it.

11. **Make it feel real not “realistic”**
To bring your adventures to life you must have fun with the innocence and fantasy of the game.

12. **Don’t create a story to win. Again.**
Just to be clear.

13. **The storyteller is not “God”**
You’ll always have the final word, but don’t let the power fool you. If you think you can do whatever you want, you’ll find yourself without players very soon

## Tips on Storytelling
##### Improvise
There will be times your players suggest something wild or illogic. Try not to say “No” if they suggest it, it must be because they find it fun. Roll with it, improvise and try to make it fit into the setting and story.

##### Prepare Random Encounters
Sometimes players get to a point you didn’t expect, so prepare some bad dudes and their Pokémon. 
This should be used only when it’s really necessary, not as part of your story. If you don’t use this Encounter in the game session, save it for later.

##### Give Emergency clues
Many times Players will miss a VERY CRUCIAL clue. Maybe it was right under their nose, but now they can’t go any further without it or the story will take a bitter turn. 
In such cases, you may have to move the clue from place to place in case it is needed. Maybe it’s time to use the random encounter or have an ally appear.
Prioritize story flow over puzzles and mechanics.

##### Positive reinforcement
Perhaps your Players are getting out of character or being disruptive. **Keep Calm.** Talk to them.
Don’t punish your players in-game for something that’s happening out of it. Engage them, give them goals and reward their achievements. You may also try converting the interactions and comments they make out-of-game to in-game. The results may surprise you.
