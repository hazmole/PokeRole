## Creating a Story
Now it’s time to derail the train of destiny with some booms and bams! Characters expect to live adventures. When they get out looking for trouble they are gonna find you ready.
Being a Storyteller and creating a story is not as hard as anyone would think. Relax and have fun with any crazy idea. Just remember that you are here to make sure that everyone is having fun.

To start, talk to your players and ask them how they wish to play, what they expect from the story, and what their perceptions of the Pokémon world are.

You have to unify their perception to make sure their characters are being brought to life with a clear idea about how this society works and their attitude towards Pokémon and other humans. You can even share a brief summary of what’s to come.

**Listen to their concerns and also express your own.**
Remember that it is also their responsibility to create fun characters that can contribute to the story.

Someone who antagonizes other players or the storyteller is not doing their job as a player correctly. 
**Make sure no one creates a character that cannot be befriended.**

Once everyone is on the same page, it’s time to get prepared.

### Ideas for Adventures
##### Pokémon Journey
**Type**: Exploration
**Focus**: The Pokémon Lore
**Game Plan**: Design geographic Points of Interest surrounding the Players.
**Place NPCs**: Each NPC may be a local or another trainer with a personal connection to this Point of Interest.
**Place Obstacles**: Each obstacle may be completed only through the use of certain Pokémon and their specific Moves.

##### Missions
**Type**: Action
**Focus**: The Pokémon Battles
**Game Plan**: Design an Antagonist currently hurting the Players, the Pokémon, the environment or the people.
**Place Enemies**: Each enemy should have one or more Pokémon ready to impede the progression of the Party.

##### Intrigue
**Type**: Investigation
**Focus**: The Human Characters
**Game Plan**:  Design an Antagonist and an evil plan.
**Place NPCs**: Each NPC may be a local or another trainer with a personal connection to this Point of Interest.
**Place Clues**: One clue may be collected through Fight Skills, another may be collected through Social Skills, other may be collected through Survival skills; other may be collected through Knowledge Skills. All clues should revolve around an imminent danger.

### Playtime Duration
A game session lasts from 2 hours to 4 hours. 

Take into account that during that timeframe, players will only be able to perform 2 or 3 well described objectives and still leave some room for character development.
Battles won’t always be necessary; normal people have troubles, tension and dire moments without having to fight for their lives every day. A battle is best used as the culmination of bad decisions or very tense circumstances. 
**This is a game about drama, not grinding battles.**

### The Many ways to tell a story
Depending on the goals of the Players, there is always a way to make the process of storytelling easier.

There are three main ways to tell a story in this game:

{{< boxmd >}}
### Chronicle
Some stories are too long to be told in one game session. A Chronicle is a grand adventure with one main plot and usually one recurring villain. This kind of story can get really epic and can take months of gaming sessions.
It was made a common belief that this kind of storytelling was the normal mode to play, however, it is not. 

This is hard mode.

It’s common to see people start a Chronicle and never finish it, so keep it simple.
Communication between players and storyteller makes all the difference.

### Episodic
Picture it like watching a TV Show, a single session is a complete adventure on its own. 
Many things could change for better or worse, however, let it be powerful. Allow the players to learn something from it. The fact that they can 
return to their normal lives doesn’t mean they went home empty-handed.

It is possible to begin to play in an Episodic way and then throw some Chronicle elements.

### Storyteller Rotation
Storyteller Rotation has a great advantage due to many people taking turns at storytelling. 
The characters will be provided with many more kinds of adventures because everyone has a unique way of thinking. 

Storytellers may take a break and also play their characters and there’s more time to write better adventures.
It’s like watching a series of movies telling the comings and goings of the Characters. It is very similar to a normal Chronicle that is combined with Episodic Storytelling.

### All Players should...
##### Go with the flow
<u>Stay in character and actively role-play</u>, so instead of saying: “I send out my dragon pokémon and I order it to attack or whatever...” Act as if your character was really in the situation and say: “Garchop, go! Charge using Dragon rush!” So don't be shy and let's have fun!

##### Stay Focused
Sometimes not much is happening, or maybe your character is not on the scene. <u>Be calm, listen, and stay focused.</u> Paying attention when the storyteller is speaking is a common courtesy. It will make the game flow faster and smoother.

##### Work as a Team
The other players are members of your group, you should be friendly to them and their characters. <u>You guys are a team and should work as such.</u> Antagonizing other party members for your own amusement is disruptive and disrespectful. Don’t be THAT guy.

##### Request Goals
Are you trying to defeat the Gym leaders? Exploring old ruins full of strange Pokémon? Make characters to fit that goal. If for some reason you are at a loss of what to do, you should <u>ask the Storyteller</u> to do a retell on the important plot points.

##### Not obsess about rules and mechanics
Remember that the Storyteller will decide what’s appropriate in the story. If there is a conflict or a stalemate <u>use common sense</u> and prioritize the story flow over anything else.

##### Try out Storytelling!
Everyone has the ability to tell a story, we want to encourage you to try it from time to time.
<u>It’s a wonderful experience and it’s easier than you’d think.</u>
We’re sure you can do it!

## Laws of Storytelling
1. **Don’t create a story to win**
This is not about how you are going to defeat the players.

2. **Don’t fret over minuscule details**
Your job is to create a mood, an atmosphere. You don’t have to describe where every single object is. Let their imaginations do the work, this will save time and make the game flow uninterrupted.

3. **Help the players get into their characters**
Players are not really inside the Pokémon world. Don’t expect them to perform as you imagined. Try to tell them how their characters feel and what they are thinking. It’s useful to place thoughts in them from time to time.

4. **The game is not only about mechanics**
This game is about active role-playing, don’t get too deep into the numbers, the rules, and pop-up combat. It’s never as important as the drama.

5. **Actively Role-Play**
This game requires active role-playing. You are not only preparing to tell a story, you are also getting prepared for acting. The same law applies to the Players. Add spice by describing the actions and the Moves of their Characters and Pokémon in the game.

6. **Use tools**
Even if you have a beautiful voice, use appropriate music and sound effects. You may print maps or show your players pictures of the places they are in. This will help everyone to be in the same tune and will make your story a lot more interesting. 

7. **Get prepared**
It’s not ok to walk into the room not knowing what you are going to say. Improvisation can only take you so far.

8. **Use Time**
Use time in your favor. You can use Flashbacks, Fast-Forwards, or Pause the session if you need some time to think. Taking breaks is always nice.

9. **Make sure everyone is having fun**
You are not their entertainer, but you have to make sure everyone is taking part in the story. From the most talkativeand extrovert to the most shy and timid of your players.

10. **Start as close to the end as possible**
Long introductions are boring. Even If there is something very important from the past, try to use exposition to say it.

11. **Make it feel real not “realistic”**
To bring your adventures to life you must have fun with the innocence and fantasy of the game.

12. **Don’t create a story to win. Again.**
Just to be clear.

13. **The storyteller is not “God”**
You’ll always have the final word, but don’t let the power fool you. If you think you can do whatever you want, you’ll find yourself without players very soon

## Tips on Storytelling
##### Improvise
There will be times your players suggest something wild or illogic. Try not to say “No” if they suggest it, it must be because they find it fun. Roll with it, improvise and try to make it fit into the setting and story.

##### Prepare Random Encounters
Sometimes players get to a point you didn’t expect, so prepare some bad dudes and their Pokémon. 
This should be used only when it’s really necessary, not as part of your story. If you don’t use this Encounter in the game session, save it for later.

##### Give Emergency clues
Many times Players will miss a VERY CRUCIAL clue. Maybe it was right under their nose, but now they can’t go any further without it or the story will take a bitter turn. 
In such cases, you may have to move the clue from place to place in case it is needed. Maybe it’s time to use the random encounter or have an ally appear.
Prioritize story flow over puzzles and mechanics.

##### Positive reinforcement
Perhaps your Players are getting out of character or being disruptive. **Keep Calm.** Talk to them.
Don’t punish your players in-game for something that’s happening out of it. Engage them, give them goals and reward their achievements. You may also try converting the interactions and comments they make out-of-game to in-game. The results may surprise you.
