## Health Points (HP)
Health Points measure the state of your character’s body. 

All living beings have a **Base HP (BHP)**, a representation of their species resilience to damage and pain.Something that could cause a crippling injury to some creatures may feel like a sting to a different species, it all depends on how their body is built.

To calculate your total HP you must **add the number of points you have in Vitality to your Base HP.** 

{{< boxmd >}}
Humans have a Base HP of 4

Each Pokémon Base HP is listed within its Pokédex entry.
{{< /boxmd >}}

For example:
{{< example >}}
Marco is a **human**, his Base HP is 4, 
and his Vitality score is 2. 
**Marco has a total HP of 6.**

Marco’s **Marowak** has a Base HP of 
4, and its Vitality score is 4.
**Marowak’s total HP is 8.**
{{< /example >}}

**Whenever you receive damage, you will lose HP.**

This HP loss is only temporary and can be recovered with time or medicine. If you receive damage equal your total HP, you will be **unable to move** and you'll **faint**. 

If you keep receiving damage after fainting, that damage will become Lethal. That means your wounds will be more severe and your life could be in danger.
Some Moves performed by Pokémon may deal Lethal Damage directly.
Receiving **Lethal Damage** equal to your total HP means **the character dies**.

## Will Points
Through history, people have achieved great feats that normally would seem impossible. 

A frail woman suddenly lifting a giant boulder to save her infant son trapped underneath, or a man with a broken leg getting up to run from a fire.

In those scenarios, people used all of their might, breaking the limits of their own physical restrictions in order achieve something greater.

The **Will** Attribute measures just how far your inner strength can take you.

{{< boxmd >}}
Every human and Pokémon has Will equal to: Insight +2.
{{< /boxmd >}}

Storyteller may call for players and Pokémon to make a roll using their Will score to overcome fear, rage, or sadness, also as a call for conscience when attempting misdeeds. 
Will points can also be spent to resist pain and have a better chance to succeed at any roll.

Here is how it works:
{{< boxmd >}}
Announce that your character or Pokémon are giving all they’ve got.
* **Spend 1 Will Point to ignore 1 Pain/Stress Penalization for the rest of the scene.**
Note: This means that if you spend 2 Will Points you'll ignore 2 Pain Penalizations and so on.
* **Spend 1 Will Point to reroll 1 unsuccessful die from all your Rolls during this Round.**
{{< /boxmd >}}

After you spend a point, however, your character will be worn out, **if you run out of Will Points the character will lose consciousness and faint at the end of the Round.** Just from the sheer strain of going beyond the limit.

**Pokémon and Humans do not come to this world with the ability to spend Will Points whenever they want.**
It is something that creatures would use only in extreme situations, and even then, most people just don’t have what it takes.

**The Trainer has to teach his Pokémon to get a hold of this inner strength.** Maybe later they will be able to use the power of their Will.

If a Trainer is not experienced in using his or her own inner strength, it is possible the Pokémon won’t be either. 
Most of the non-player characters will not use their Will Points as it is something only the most proficient Trainers and Pokémon are able to do.

To recover one spent Will Point your character must:
Rest for a few days, feel accomplished by having achieved something great, follow their nature, or get them as a reward for good role-play
