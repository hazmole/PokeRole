## Ranking
Even Champions were rookies at a certain point in their lives.

Today you begin your Pokémon Journey. Many adventures lie ahead. Perhaps you always dreamt on becoming a Trainer, or maybe some circumstances forced you to take this path. If you're willing to work hard, someday you may even become the best.
A good Trainer is capable of taking a little scaredy Pokémon and turn it into a champion, but in order to do that, you'll have to journey across the world and complete many achievements.

**Rank determines your ability to train a Pokémon and it represents your overall personal growth.**

When it comes to Ranking, you’re teaching your Pokémon how to fight and survive, but you're also teaching them how to unleash their potential, control their most advanced Moves and to adjust to any strategy you need.

{{< boxmd >}}
The Ranking System works through Achievements.
When a Trainer completes all the achievements required to upgrade, them and all their trained Pokémon will gain the Benefits.
Storyteller may add or change achievements required to improve a Trainer's Rank.

Overall, Rank is a representation of time and effort put into a particular lifestyle, Pokémon Training in this case.

**Wild Pokémon also have a Rank** and obtain the benefits from it, it's up to the Storyteller's discretion to determine the Rank of a wild Pokémon.

{{< boxmd >}}
Pokémon will not follow orders from a Trainer with a Rank inferior to theirs.
{{< /boxmd >}}

So if you catch or trade a Pokémon with a Rank superior to yours, its Rank will remain as it is, making it almost impossible for you to control or make it obey you.
**The League does not look favorably on trainers who cannot control their Pokémon in official matches.**
Trainers who seem incapable of controlling their Pokémon during a tournament or an official match are disqualified.

You'll have to increase your abilities as a Trainer to fully tame and unleash a stronger Pokémon's potential.

**The good news is that if you catch or obtain a Pokémon with a Rank lower than your own, its Rank will be upgraded to match yours after some Training Sessions.**
Because your Rank is also a reflection of your mastery, you also learned how to get the best out of a Pokémon. Now you are able to generate results faster.
