## Creating a Character
In Pokémon the Role Playing Game, you must create a  Pokémon Trainer also called a Character. 
This persona will be your avatar inside the story.
You’ll  choose  a  starting  Pokémon  too,  both  are  very important  choices,  remember  that  your  Pokémon  are  often  a  reflection  of  your  trainer’s  ersonality  and  aspirations.

When creating a character, choose something that’s fun to play, allow yourself to dream, be silly and laugh at your most crazy ideas. 
You may want to be a hero from a cartoon or base your identity on someone you admire or even be a parody of a famous character.
Preferably, pick a personality that you can perform and act easily because you will be acting a lot.
 
Remember to build a character that can contribute to the story and not one that will harm it.

### ⬛ Trainer Concepts
A Trainer is anyone who has an official license to train Pokémon, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg of your character’s life. Think of a job or an occupation for your character; he or she might be a doctor, a fisherman, a hallway monitor at school, an aspiring model or anything you find fun. Give your trainer a goal and help her find the right personality traits.
You  and  the  other  players  will  need  to  decide  what kind  of  characters  you’d  like  to  create  and  this  will  require some teamwork between you, your playmates, and the storyteller to make a great party of players.

Complement  your  character  with  those  of  your  playmates and work together to achieve your trainer’s goals. 


### ⬛ Personality and Background
Tell your storyteller and playmates a little bit about your Trainer’s past. 
 
Your Trainer is whatever you want it to be, flesh him/her out, this is not just an empty husk that you use to move within the game.It’s a character with dreams and aspirations, with flaws and fears. 

To make a fleshed out and believable character ask yourself  these  questions  and  voice  them  as  your character would.

{{< boxmd >}}
1. What’s your name? 
2. What is your age? 
3. What’s your Nature? 
4. What’s your occupation/concept? 
5. What do you expect from the world of Pokémon? 

And most importantly: 

6. What’s your goal in the world of Pokémon?
7. What’s your motivation for that goal?
8. How are you going to contribute to make this world better?

{{< /boxmd >}}

Answering  those  questions  will  make  the  storyteller’s job  a  lot  easier  to  give  your  character  the  challenges he or she needs. Don’t forget that good communication  between players and storyteller will make the story flow much more smoothly for everyone.

{{< notice story "說書人筆記" >}}
 A player **should not start playing** until he or she has answered these questions.

## Filling a Trainer Sheet
Once your Trainer’s concept is ready, you may proceed to distribute their Attribute Points and their Skill Points.
All of a Trainer's Attributes and Social Attributes begin at 1 Point.
Newbie characters usually begin the game as Teens at Starter Rank. For more information regarding Ranks, see p. 30


{{< boxmd >}}
### Attributes
Teens  have  2  points  to  distribute.  You  **may  have  extra Points to distribute depending on your Rank.**
* Strength: ●<fill>●</fill>○○○

### ⬛ I’m not a Newbie!
Some stories are best suited for experienced Characters who are older and better skilled at what they do.
If you wish to play at an **older age** or **higher Rank**, you can follow these simple guidelines:

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Rank</th>
		<th>Extra Attribute Points</th>
		<th>Extra Social Points</th>
		<th>Skill Points</th>
		<th>Skill Limit</th>
	</tr>
	<tr><td> Starter </td><td> 0 </td><td> 0 </td><td> 5 </td><td> 1 </td></tr>
	<tr><td> Beginner </td><td> 2 </td><td> 2 </td><td> +4 </td><td> 2 </td></tr>
	<tr><td> Amateur </td><td> 4 </td><td> 4 </td><td> +3 </td><td> 3 </td></tr>
	<tr><td> Ace </td><td> 6 </td><td> 6 </td><td> +2 </td><td> 4 </td></tr>
	<tr><td> Professional </td><td> 8 </td><td> 8 </td><td> +1 </td><td> 5 </td></tr>
</table>

Assign all Skill Points from a Rank, before assigning all Skill Points from the next Rank. The amount of Points in a single Skill cannot exceed the Skill Limit.
 
Age is also a factor you must take into account, the fact that you are old enough to have a Trainer's license does not mean you are ready to travel the world unsupervised. Trainer Characters can be younger/older and thus **start the game** with higher or lower Attributes and Social Attributes.

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Age</th>
		<th>Attribute/Social Points</th>
	</tr>
	<tr><td> Kids </td><td> 0/0 </td>
	<tr><td> Teens </td><td> 2/2 </td>
	<tr><td> Adults </td><td> 4/4 </td>
	<tr><td> Seniors </td><td> 3/6 </td>
</table>
<p class="foot">*Base starting age for new games.</p>
