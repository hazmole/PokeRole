## Creating a Pokémon
A  Pokémon  will  be  commanded  by  their  trainer  but  within the game, they won’t be controlled by a player.

It’s  part  of  the  storyteller’s  job  to  play  and  tell  you how your Pokémon reacts to its surroundings or how it   communicates with you.
Think about it as having a pet, you can ask it to follow you or to stop chewing the carpet, but you are not really inside its mind. You can only learn what it thinks and feels by  interacting  with  it  and  reading  its  expressions  and  attitudes.

 While  similar,  Pokémon  are NOT people.  They are mostly incapable  of  speech  nor  they see the world the same as humans do.

 Most  Pokémon  are  capable  of Evolving,  to  learn  more  about the different ways Evolution is triggered, head to p. 73

Pokémon do not need to have a concept as Trainers do. 
Each Pokémon will behave according to the instinct their species gives them and following their Nature (p. 38).
They tend to have natures that go accord with its species behavior but they may vary.

That  means  that  two  Pokémon  of  the  same  species will probably want the same things but their different Natures will change how they will try to attain them.

If you are just starting your adventure, head to the Pokédex section of this book. p. 88
Look for this icon on the Pokédex entries:

◎

Pokémon  marked  with  this  icon,  are  good Starter options for Novice Trainers.

A Starter Pokémon will be your companion during your journey,  so  it’s  better  if  you  choose  a  Pokémon  that matches you Trainer’s personality.

And don’t despair if you could not start with the Pokémon you wanted, this world is very vast and catching Pokémon  is half the fun.
