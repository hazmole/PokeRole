## Trainer’s Basics
Traveling alone through the wild can be pretty tough. Your Pokémon companions will keep you safe, but they won’t make it more comfortable. Most of the time you will be sleeping on top of rocks and going hundreds of kilometers on foot.

Serious trainers need to carry items to help them reach their goals while diminishing the inconveniences that may arise on the journey.

<b style="font-size: 1.2em;">Every Trainer should have these Items at all times:</b>

### Money
You’ll need money to buy goods. A Trainer that’s just starting, normally has $1500 to spend. You can earn more PokéDollars by winning battles against other trainers, or you may lose them if you are defeated! 

You may also get a small job to get more money. Try to find one that employs humans and Pokémon so your companions help you out too. This way, you 
get some extra income and lend a hand to people in need.

### Food
Food for you and your Pokémon. There are Trainers that let their Pokémon roam free to find themselves something to eat, but it is safer to feed them yourself. Some Pokémon might look like a very tasty treat in the eyes of a hungry, wild Pokémon.

### Pokémon Items
Your Pokémon will protect you from danger but you are responsible for their safety. You should at least have some healing items to nurse them back to health and Pokéballs to carry them safely.

### Camping gear
Shelter is hard to find in the wild. Nasty creatures tend to inhabit caves and refuges, so you better bring a tent, a sleeping bag or at least some tools for everyday use unless you want to sleep in the floor of a cave full of Zubat filth.

### Transport
Distances between one town to another might be quite long. Trainers try to travel as fast as possible and while the most rich people will travel on an automobile or a motorcycle, most people prefer to ride a bicycle to travel a little faster without investing in fuel. Other trainers may be seen riding their Pokémon wherever they go. But if you don’t have the means to get any of that, then you better get some comfy shoes and start walking.

### Trainer Gear
Camping can be fun when you have the tools you need to be comfortable. These are some examples of what you can bring with you on your journey. Each heavy or big item you buy comes within its own Pokéball to ease the weight and store it back quickly.

A spacious tent for your group to stay a cozy night.

* Small Camping Tent, $800.00
A comfortable space for 1 person, or 2 if you don’t mind squeezing.

Not too comfortable. You’ll be able to sleep warm and dry but after a few nights your back may hurt.

* Camping Stove & Cookware, $2,000.00

With this luxury set you’ll always have a warm meal.

* Canned Meal, $15.00
It’s nothing fancy but there’s no need to travel on an empty stomach. One can is enough for one day.

* Regional Map, $50.00
A map with the marked routes, cities and Pokémon Centers of the region you are in.

* Compass, $100.00

{{< mynotice story >}}
Cities and towns in the world of Pokémon are just like ours. There are stores for goods and services. Your players can buy items for the right price.

Just remember to emphasize the use of their Pokémon moves and abilities to solve the challenges they face. 
That is, instead of buying a rope why not have Bulbasaur use its vines instead?

### Items for Traveling
As Mentioned before, distances can be quite long in the world of Pokémon, not only you’ll need to travel on the road, you’ll need to go trough forests, mountains, snow peaks, deserts, seas and even fly through the sky. You can travel the world with just your feet and some sturdy shoes, but having something else to transport you wouldn’t be a bad idea.

...

If you don’t wanna venture trough the wilderness you can stay on the marked routes, or even take a bus to the next city; just remember that wild Pokémon and new experiences for you and your companions are out there. 
If you are lucky you might even catch a rare Pokémon or find some treasure deep in the caves.


### Protection Items
While you might want to find and catch new Pokémon, sometimes your team will be too weary to defend you properly, or maybe some dangerous monsters are in the area, whatever the case it’s always better to be on the safe side.

...

Be sure to know when to run away from a battle in the wild, most Pokémon won’t chase you outside their territory, but if you are feeling bold you’d better have some of these items or a good team to defend you from harm, it is not wise to keep fighting until all your Pokémon faint and you get in the direct way of danger.
