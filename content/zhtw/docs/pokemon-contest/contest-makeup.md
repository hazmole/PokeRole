## Contest Makeup
Let's go over the parts of the Contest and what do you need to host one.

##### The Board
Contests are represented by a board. There are contests for  all  five  **Social Attributes**  (Tough,  Cool,  Beauty,  Cute and Clever),and mixes of two or more where you'll have to prove true mastery as a Coordinator.
 
##### The Contestants
These people contend not for the thrill of battle, but to show the world their performances.
Anyone  can  be  a  contestant,  from  a  housewife  to  the League's  Champion.  On  lower-ranked  Contest,  you’ll  find regular people performing simple tricks with their Pokémon; but at higher Ranks, you’ll be facing superstars!

<u>**Up to 8 contestants might participate each Contest.**</u>
Professional contestants are called: Coordinators.

##### The Judges
Every town has a designated group of Judges for Contests, men and women with good taste. 
On the red carpets of high-end Contests you'll find Judges with a fame that rivals that of the Champions.
Secretly,  each  one  has  a  preference  for  a  certain  Social  Attribute they can't help but award more hearts to. **You'll have to appeal to them and impress them in order to win.**

##### The Audience
People watching your performance want to be entertained, 
they wish to enjoy themselves. Be good to them and they'll 
be good to you. 
If they clap or cheer for you, the judges will be impressed, if 
they "boo!" you will "boo boo".

##### Contest Difficulty
There are four Contest difficulties, each one with their 
own challenges and rewards.

* **Normal Contest**

Choose the difficulty you'll be participating in.
Each Difficulty requires you to score a minimum number of successes in your performance in order to carter the level of expectations of the Public and the Judges.

<table style="width:60%;">
	<tr><th>Difficulty</th><th>Required Successes</th></tr>
	<tr><td>Normal</td><td>1</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Super</td><td>2</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Hyper</td><td>3</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Master</td><td>4</td></tr>
</table>

If you score the required successes, you get to draw a Reaction Card, more successes can make you draw more cards and ignore bad reactions!
But you fail to meet the minimum of Successes Required the public will start booing at you.
