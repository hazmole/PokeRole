## Steps of the Show
### 1. Presentation Stage
During  this  stage,  Contestants  are  parading  in  their  costumes and making their introductions to decide who will go first. **Each Contestant rolls their highest Social attribute (related to the Contest) to decide the order in  which  the  participants  will  advance  through  the runway. Each Contestant will draw 2 Trick Cards.**

---
### 2. Performance Runway
These are the main events of the Contest.
Once  Presentation  is  done,  each  contestant  will **roll 1 die to advance the spaces** through the runway. 
Each space has a request from the judges for you and your Pokémon to perform, you must declare the judge you'll appeal to and describe and roleplay your act.

**Roll your performance with:**
<div class="middle">Social Attribute + Perform</div>

**Depending on how many successes you get, Draw one or more <u>Reaction cards</u>.** Your storyteller must narrate the reactions of the public and the judges.

On your turn, you must use a Trick card from your  hand,  this  must  be  done  before  your  performance roll, but if the Social Attribute from your Trick card, matches the one on the space you landed you will gain:

After you use a Trick Card, shuffle it back in the deck and draw another one.

### The Game's Objetive:
Reach the END GOAL without breaking down, while gaining as many Hearts as possible from the Judges.

### Tips for the aspiring Coordinator
1. Be prepared to roleplay your performances, as the board will only give you a brief idea of what you must do before the audience.
2. Save money. Contests are not an everyday event but they are an expensive one at that. Between entry fees, costumes and accesories, be sure to carry extra cash!
3. Just like Pokémon battles, Contests can be a real challenge, don't be disheartened if you lose because that's part of growth in the Pokémon world.
4.  Same  as  Pokémon  battles,  you  will  need  to  train and raise Pokémon that stand out and thrive with the  attention. Shy Pokémon won't fare well in contests!
