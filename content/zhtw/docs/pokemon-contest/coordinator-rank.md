## Coordinator Ranks
We mentioned before that Rank is a representation of time and effort put into a particular lifestyle, There are Ranks  for  activities  besides  Pokémon  Training,  these Ranks will add benefits to your Character.

If you dedicate yourself to winning Contests you will be able  to  gain  Coordinator  Ranks,  these  **do  not  replace your Pokémon Trainer Rank** but add to it.
