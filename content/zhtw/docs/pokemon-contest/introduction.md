# Pokemon Contest
Pokémon  Trainers  usually  make  Pokémon  Battles  their main  focus  and  it’s  all  right  if  you  like  that  kind  of crude  and  violent  entertainment,  but  why  would  you want to be exchanging blows like a brute when you can follow a lifestyle of luxury and riches thanks to Pokémon  Contests?

## What are Pokémon Contests?
When you talk about **Pokémon Contests**, you talk about the most  profitable  show  business  in  this  world. These  major events take many forms, from **Beauty Pageants**, to **Science Fairs, Staged Battles, Music Festivals**, or most commonly, the All-in-one show for everyone to mesmerize at the talent and grace of Trainers and their Pokémon companions. 

They  are  pretty  much  like  a  talent  show; You  present yourself and your Pokémon before an Audience and the Judges to see if your presentation meets all the required criteria; if it does, you win! Sounds easy, right? 
No Damage, Critical Hits, or Fainting standing between you and that awesome First-Place Ribbon. But wait! Just because no one faints at the end of these shows doesn’t mean the competition isn’t fierce but rather the opposite, top tier Contests are full of highly competitive Trainers. 

People  fall  apart  under  the  spotlight.  Criticism  is  fierce, Judges can be ruthless and even the audience can be a tough nut to crack.
These are not battles of power, you will use all of your social skills to confidently advance the rounds and earn the admiration of your peers and the good graces of the judges. 

In a Pokémon Contest you are trying your best to show that you and your Pokémon have the talent, charisma and  expertise  to  give  a  performance  that  will  astound  the world.

## Confidence and Stress
To present yourself before an audience you need to be confident enough to handle the stress that comes from having to entertain hundreds if not thousands of people.

**Natures**  give  a  specific  amount  of  **Confidence  Points** (p. 38) **You may think of Confidence as a “Social HP”** that will help you keep your cool under pressure.

**Losing Confidece**  is similar to losing HP, but instead of suffering damage to your body, you’ll **suffer stress and emotional damage.** You’ll get progressively nervous and  anxious,  then  histerical.  Some  will  crumble  under  the pressure of being before an audience and if the stress gets too heavy you may completely shut down, explode into tears or go into an angry rampage. That is what we call a **Breakdown**.

Any Contestant, Trainer or Pokémon, who suffers a Breakdown on stage, will be automatically disqualified.

<table>
	<tr><th>Confidence</th><th>Emotional State</th><th>Stress Penalization</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Full Confidence </td>
		<td>Positive </td>
		<td>None. You can do this! </td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Half Confidence<br/>(Rounded down) </td>
		<td>Nervous </td>
		<td>Allies nearby will lose 1 Confidence Point each Round. </td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1 remaining Confidence Point </td>
		<td>Freaking out </td>
		<td>Roll every action twice, keep the lowest roll. </td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Zero Confidence </td>
		<td>Breakdown </td>
		<td>All Social Rolls fail automatically. </td></tr>
</table>

**Stress Penalizations stack on each other** and can only be removed through **Trick cards** or by spending time relaxing. Will  Points  can  also  help  you  ignore  the  ill  effects  of stress for a short while.

Some Trainers take advantage of the show to bully other Pokémon into losing Confidence using Tricks while others use said Tricks to help their peers to Regain it.

If  you  or  your  Pokémon  lose  confidence  you'll  need  to regain it ASAP since contests are a team effort you'll be in trouble if one of you starts freaking out.

**Stress  Penalizations  are  usually reserved  for  Contest  situations** but they can also come into play in particularly stressful Pokémon Battles at your discretion.
