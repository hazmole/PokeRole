## Pokedex
There are almost a thousand known species of Pokémon in the world, some better known than others.

In this section of the book you’ll find all the information available about most of them.

To create and train your Pokémon you’ll need to check its  Pokédex  entry,  Ability  and  Moves  in  the  Pokémon  Abilities and Pokémon Moves sections of this book.

Now, this might seem like a lot of information to take in. How will you ever memorize all these names, data, Moves and special Abilities?

Don’t worry! You don’t have to memorize it at all! 
Simply take this information to customize your Pokémon and build a unique character.

Think of your Pokémon as an extension of  your  Trainer’s  abilities.  Pokémon  work like powers at your disposition. 
If  you  want  Ice  powers  you  should  capture an Ice Pokémon. If you want to be a bard, get a Pokémon with Sing.
{{< /mynotice >}}

Your Pokémon are capable of working wonders with ease. They have many abilities and maybe a dozen moves to learn. Focus only on what you want.

Think about it this way: 
**You have 6 slots available for customization.**

Each and every Pokémon you carry will have a special role in your party. You can complement your team any way you want.

Perhaps you want a bulky Pokémon that can take a hit or a fast companion to sweep an enemy party, a cute kitten  who’s only there to charm the girls or a passionate mouse to cheer everyone’s fighting spirit.

Your imagination is the limit.

Use  the  tools  on  this  book  and your imagination to create unique Pokémon. They are part of a living world, take your time and describe their behaviors.

Keep in mind that a Pokémon’s uniqueness is not in its Strength or its high Attributes, but in the role playing you get from your players thanks to it.

### Form Variations
A few Pokémon have different looks even when they are the same species. Sometimes this change is merely aesthetic, other times they evolve into a variant and cannot change  back. And  other  times  a  certain  move  or  item triggers these changes.
Some  of  these  variants  can  only  be  found  in  certain parts of the world. The different forms may change their  attribute  Limit  distribution,  grant  them  a  new  power and/or change their Type.
For Mega-Evolution your trainer will have to meet certain conditions for the form to be stable and long-lasting.

**Make sure to read all the entries on the different Form Variations of these Pokémon.**

Should one of your Pokémon change forms, during the game, **it is convenient to have the character sheets of all its Form variations.**
**<u>Each  Form  would  have  its  own  set  of  Attributes  and points on them according to your Rank, even if they are different from each other.</u>**

You  may  use  your  own  discretion as to what triggers the changes on  certain Pokémon. It may be an Item, energy or perhaps they are able to change at will.

## A Note on World Building
This world is vast and extense with many regions to  explore. It is very easy to get carried away, wanting  to  start  really  big,  however,  we  recommend  you start small.

Start in a town or a Small city, let the world expand in the direction your players want to explore rather than putting them on a big world map with no direction  on where to start.
In the end they can end up going through every city, just  not  in  the  “expected”  order,  or  even  travel through  regions,  changing  leagues,  skipping  gyms,  or even end up in a completely made up place.

You  will  notice  this  method  will  develop  a  much more  organic  adventure  than  trying  to  railroad  a party through a map of cities, going from point A to point B each time an objective is “cleared”.

This  is  also  beneficial  for  the  Storyteller  as  you won’t have to prepare a grand set of chained events  unfolding all through the region, but simply prepare the small sections the players will be exploring for the day.

## A Note on Breeding Pokémon
When  two  Pokémon  love  each  other  very  very much they’ll spend some time together and then a Pokémon Egg will appear. This is not just a tale that the adults tell children; no one really knows how these eggs pop into existence. It is one of the many mysteries in the world of Pokémon.

Baby Pokémon need a lot of nurturing and love to grow happy and strong. 
All  Pokémon  can  fall  in  love  with  each  other, regardless  of  their  species. The  baby  will  often come out as the First-stage species of the mother.

Due  to  parents  not  always  being  of  the  same  species,  **Baby  Pokémon  may  show  traits  that their species doesn’t normally have thanks to having a parent with a different set of powers.**

This isn’t a game to get endless Pokémon eggs in search  for  the  perfect  offspring,  should  players  get  their  hands  on  a  Pokémon  egg,  remember to  give  it  the  importance  it  deserves,  it’s  not just time and heat what will make it hatch, it is through love and kindness that the baby Pokémon will come out. 

It  may  take  a  few  weeks  or  a  few  months  but when  the  shell  begins  to  crack  it’ll  be  a  big  moment of happiness!  
Be ready to change diapers and bottle-feed your new bundle of joy.
