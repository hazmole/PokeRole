## 10 Tips for Successful Battles

##### 1. Train Your Pokémon.
Through training you can try different builds of Attributes, Skills and Moves and find powerful combitations. If you want to be a strong Trainer you need strong Pokémon.

##### 2. Use your advantages.
Not only Type advantages, consider what your Pokémon is good at and how you will exploit that in your favor.

##### 3. Use or create weaknesses.
If the foe is too strong or fast, what will you use to counter it? Perhaps the foe is using  a move with low Accuracy that can be evaded, and an attribute reduction will surely hinder its performance.

##### 4. Know your moves
Learn the Power, Accuracy and effects of the moves  you’ll  be  using  regularly  to  get  the most out of them. 

##### 5. Evade, Clash and Cover
Unless you are sure you’ll withstand the hit, evade, clash or take cover from attacks. Keep your damage intake per round as low as  possible.

##### 6. Use Multiple Actions.
Mastering multiple actions is a key to master Pokémon Battles. Bit by bit they help you gain an edge, increase your dice pools and get the most of them.

##### 7. Adapt to your opponent’s strategy.
If you keep doing the same you’ll keep getting the same result. If something isn’t working,  change your tactic or you'll lose.

##### 8. Strike at the right time.
Be  patient,  keep  your  cards  in  your  hand. 
Don’t strike too early and risk to reveal them, don’t strike too late and miss your chance to do what you wanted.

##### 9. Be decisive
Don’t  make  the  battle  drag  on  forever  by taking too much time to decide what action you’ll take.

##### 10.  Keep Trying.
You and your Pokémon are a team, together you share victory and you share defeat. 
The road to success is built around failures.
Don’t lose heart, and keep trying!

As you can see, Pokémon battles are quite an exciting yet dangerous event.
Don’t be disheartened if you lose a battle. Defeat is part of the road to success. Take one step at a time.

As a trainer, you’ll need to understand just how much you can ask from your Pokémon, and they will need your guidance to push their limits.
The  secret  to  achieving  a  victory  every  time  will  be  finding the right time to make your strikes. 

There  will  be  occasions  in  which  you  will  need  to  endure a hit or two and you’ll have to choose which hits your  Pokémon  definitely  needs  to  evade;  other  times you’ll have to risk everything in a single all-or-nothing attack. 
And when things can’t get any worse, you may need to spend some Will points and let fate decide.

It is a long way for a trainer to master all of the battle strategies, but having your friends beside you will make it a lot easier if you all learn from each other. 

In any case, you’ll learn a lot more from experience, so go out there and live your own Pokémon battles!

Keep  the  fights  interesting  by  detailing  the  progression  of  the battle. Describe their actions and their effects, not only the damage spoints they take.
