## Strategies to Win
It isn’t always the strongest, the fastest, or the higher ranked Pokémon that wins the fight.

How can you defeat an Onix with only the help of a tiny Pichu?

Well, having a strategy can save the day!
In  this  section,  you  will  learn  the  many  tricks  and techniques to win almost any fight. 
Learn  them  all  and  any  Pokémon  at  your  side  will  be champion material.

### ⬛ Holding Action
When you declare to hold your action your character will remain immobile looking at the foe, this will seem like an invitation to the foe or someone else to act before you do. 

You may use the action you were holding at any point during the round.
If both you and your foe hold action the round will end with no further actions.
It means that both sides paused  the  fight to eye  each other warily...

---

### ⬛ Evading 
It is always a smart move to get away from danger. You may do this by evading attacks or finding cover.
**Once per Round you can Evade an attack**, simply have to give the order “Evade it!” or “Dodge!”. 
Your Pokémon will understand that danger is coming its way and will react as fast as possible.

**An Evasion action can be triggered regardless of initiative order at the cost of an action. All you need to do is Roll:**
<div class="middle">Dexterity + Evasion</div>

**If you score as many Succesess as your foe, you evade the attack.**
{{< highlight >}}
Evading counts as an Action, thus, acting again this Round will require another Success as stated on the table for Multiple Actions.

<b style="font-size:1.5em;">Evasion can be performed only once per Round.</b>
{{< /highlight >}}

---

### ⬛ Clashing Attacks
Some Pokémon are not dexterous enough to be constantly evading, but they can rely on their sheer power to fend off their foe’s attacks by doing what we call a Clash.

**Once per Round**, when an opponent makes its Accuracy Roll **you can order your Pokémon** to use one of its own Damaging  Moves  (i.e.  Thunderbolt,  Water  Gun,  Close Combat) **to try to deflect most of the damage** . Simply Roll: 
<div class="middle">Strength/Special + Clash</div>

If you score as many Succesess as your foe, you clash the attack and both your foe and your Pokémon will suffer 1 damage instead of the foe making a damage roll.
{{< highlight >}}
Clashing counts as an Action, thus, acting again this Round will require another Success as stated on the table for Multiple Actions. 

All Damage taken from a Clash is affected by the Super Effective and It’s Not Very Effective rule.

While not as effective as Evasion to reduce damage intake, Clashing attacks is a good option for slower but strong and resilient Pokémon.

<b style="font-size:1.5em;">Clash can be performed only once per Round.</b>
{{< /highlight >}}

{{< mynotice trainer >}}
Once you use a Move for a Clash you  can’t  repeat  it  during  the same Round; You’ll have to wait until the next one!

{{< mynotice story >}}
Support  Moves,  Moves  that  ignore  Defenses  and  Moves that have a Set Damage can’t be Clashed.

### ⬛ Taking Cover
This action will help you resist damage against **Ranged attacks depending on much of your body is covered.**

<table style="width:70%;">
	<tr><th>Body Coverage </th><th>Bonus Def/SDef vs Ranged Attacks </th></tr>
	<tr><td>1/4 </td><td>+1 </td></tr>
	<tr><td>1/2 </td><td>+2 </td></tr>
	<tr><td>Full </td><td>Cover must be destroyed </td></tr>
</table>

It is possible to avoid damage completely at Storyteller’s Discretion. A Cover may be destroyed after taking a few hits.

{{< mynotice trainer >}}
You  can  use  the  Maneuver  “Cover an Ally” to use your body as a shield for a small Pokémon.
Or you can make a big Pokémon use it to cover yourself!
{{< /mynotice >}}

---
### ⬛ Same Type Attack Bonus (STAB)
All Pokémon can control different Types of energy, but these energies will come out naturally stronger if they are from thier own Type.

For  example,  a  Grass-Type  is  stronger  at  controlling plants, while a Normal-type won't be as powerful when trying to do the same.
 
Using Moves that match their own type will give you an edge when trying to deal damage.

{{< highlight >}}
Whenever a Pokémon performs an Attack that matches one of its types you’ll get the “Same Type Attack Bonus” or STAB  for short.  

<b style="font-size:1.3em;">This adds 1 Bonus Dice to the Damage Pools of matching Type attacks.</b>
{{< /highlight >}}

---
### ⬛ Low Accuracy Moves
If you perform a move labeled with a sign like this:
{@icon frame|accuracy|命中|down|1}{@icon frame|accuracy|命中|down|2}{@icon frame|accuracy|命中|down|3}
**Remove  the  noted  number  of  Successes  from  your  Accuracy  Roll.**

{{< example >}}
Take a look at this example:

---
Pikachu is trying to attack its foe Stunky with the move Thunder. Which has an Accuracy of -2: 
{@icon dice|l|5}Pikachu’s Dice Pool, with {@icon frame|accuracy|命中|down|2} Move Accuracy
**Roll Results**: {@icon rdice|s|1}{@icon rdice|s|6|fail}{@icon rdice|s|3}{@icon rdice|s|4|fail}{@icon rdice|s|3} (-2 Successes)

---
The roll fails. A Thunder stroke in the arena but it did not hit the target.

On  Stunky’s  turn  he  uses  the  move  Smokescreen reducing Pikachu’s Accuracy by 1.
In  the  next  Round,  Pikachu’s  Accuracy  Roll  for Thunder would be:

{@icon dice|l|5}Pikachu’s Dice Pool, with {@icon frame|accuracy|命中|down|3} Move Accuracy
**Roll Results**: {@icon rdice|s|1}{@icon rdice|s|6|fail}{@icon rdice|s|6|fail}{@icon rdice|s|4|fail}{@icon rdice|s|2} (-3 Successes)

---
Pikachu would have to train its skills to get better at controlling this kind of attacks.
{{< /example >}}


**Pain  Penalizations  and  other  penalties  may  remove even more successes from your Roll.**
The  power  of  some  Moves  might  seem  tempting,  but you’ll need a lot more than powerful moves to win your battles.

If your foe is relying on powerful but unaccurate Moves, don’t  be  scared,  make  their  advantage  become  their disadvantage by Evading or Clashing.

---
### ⬛ Attributes: Increase & Reduction
You will notice that some moves are marked with this kind of icons:
{@icon frame|self|特質|up|1}{@icon frame|self|特質|down|1} {@icon frame|target|特質|up|1}{@icon frame|target|特質|down|1}

Most of them don’t deal damage but increase or reduce the attributes of a Pokémon instead.


It is a valid strategy to reduce your foe’s Attributes to get  an  advantage.  If  you  combine  this  with  increasing your own Pokémon Attributes, you will be on the right path to victory.

**A Move may increase or decrease an attribute by 1, 2 or 3 points, this effect is only temporary.**
These  points  do  not  stack  on  the  same  attribute,  but instead only take into account the move with the highest modifier.

{{< example >}}
A  Shellder  with  a  Defense  of  5  used  the  move  Withdraw as its first action.
Its  Defense  will  be  increased  1  point  making  it  a  total of 6.

On  its  next  action,  Shellder  used  the  move  Iron Defense,  which  increases  its  Defense  by  2  points. 
Its Defense will now be 7. **The effects of Withdraw  are replaced.**

If  Shellder  uses  Iron  Defense  once  again  the  next round, its Defense would remain unchanged.
{{< /example >}}

The same rule applies for decreasing the attributes of a Pokémon, with the only exception that once an attribute  is  decreased  to  just  1  point,  it  cannot  be  decreased  further.
Some **Held Items** will directly affect the attributes of a Pokémon but their effects will not stack along with the effects of a move and you will take into account only the highest modifier.

{{< highlight >}}
Temporary increases of attributes can only make a Pokémon reach a maximum of 10 Points.

That  means  that  if  your  Pokémon  already  has a score of 10 in an attribute it won’t be able to  increase it further.

If  your  Pokémon  has  reached  the  limit  score  on its attribute, and increases it using a move or ability,  as long as it keeps it on 10 or less it will be able to do so without problems.
{{< /highlight >}}{{< highlight >}}
<p style="font-size:1.2em;"><b>When combined with Abilities, Pokémon can  achieve  incredible  power  through temporary  increases  in  Power,  Defense and Speed.</b></p>
{{< /highlight >}}

Take these examples of combining moves and abilities to increase your own attributes or reduce your foe’s:

{{< example >}}
Your Floatzel has 4 points of Dexterity. Its Ability is Swift Swim, which increases Dexterity by 2 Points during Rain weather. 

It  is  raining  at  the  moment  and  Floatzel  uses  the Move Agility in its turn.  This move adds 2 Points to the user’s Dexterity.  

Floatzel ends up with 8 total Dexterity Points: 
4 points are its own, 2 from its Ability and 2 more from the Move it used. 
{{< /example >}}{{< example >}}
Your little pink Snubull goes into battle, against an aggressive Tyranitar with a Strength score of 4. Fortunately,  Snubull  has  the  ability  Intimidate, which reduces by 1 point the Strength of all foes in range.

On  its  turn,  Snubull  uses  the  move  Charm,  which means a further reduction of 2 points for the foe. By  the  end  of  Snubull’s  turn,  Tyranitar  only  has  1 point on its Strength Attribute. 

Now that doesn’t sound too menacing!
{{< /example >}}

{{< mynotice trainer >}}
It is illegal to go into an official match of  the  league  with  your  Pokémon  already buffed. You’ll have to put it back into its Pokéball and let it out when the match begins.
{{< /mynotice >}}

**All these Power-ups and downs are only temporary.**
**They  will  last  for  a  scene  or  until  the  Pokémon  is removed from battle.**

---
### ⬛ Critical Hit
**To land a Critical Hit you have to score 3 more successes than what is required for your Accuracy Roll.**
**If you do, you will add 2 dice to your Damage Pool.**

{{< example >}}
Archen is fighting Amaura. Archen managed to land a Critical-Hit with the move Crunch.
This will be Archen’s Damage Pool:

{@icon dice|m|4} Archen’s Strength
\+ {@icon dice|m|3} Crunch’s Power
\+ {@icon dice|m|2} Critical Hit Bonus
\- {@icon dice|m|2} Amaura’s Defense

Amaura is at risk of receiving a serious amount of damage from Archen’s Attack!
{{< /example >}}

Also, Moves labeled with this Icon:
{@icon crit|l}

Are called **“High-Critical”** moves.
You'll need only **2 more Successes than necessary**, to get a Critical hit! 


---
### ⬛ Holding Back
Sometimes it will be more convenient to contain the full force of your Pokémon’s attacks.

Perhaps  a  move  is  extremely  powerful  but  it  may hurt your allies as well, maybe you are fighting a wild  Pokémon you want to catch and do not want it to faint. Or  it  could  be  that  you  are  participating  in  an  official League  Tournament  and  you  cannot  use  your  favorite move by going all out.

For those cases, you give the command to “Hold Back” in order to do either of the next options:

* **Deal Half Damage.**
You make your damage roll normally but only inflict half of the damage rounded down to those affected by your attack.

* **Deal Regular Damage instead of Lethal Damage.**
If your order your Pokémon to use a move that  would deal Lethal Damage: <br/>{@icon lethal|l}

You can also add the order: “Restrain yourself!”, “Don’t use  full  force!”  or  something  along  the  lines  so  the  damage your Pokémon inflicts will not need a trip to the emergency room ...or the graveyard.


---
### ⬛ Priority and Low Priority
Many  actions  and  Moves  are  quick  and  abrupt  or  slow and  complex.  Priority  and  Low  Priority  are  terms  to  indicate which Moves get into effect outside of the normal  Initiative order. They are labeled by these signs:
{@icon frame|priority|優先度|up|1}{@icon frame|priority|優先度|down|1}

They represent Priority, which allows a Pokémon to act right away even if it’s not their turn yet.
And Low Priority, in which the Pokémon will use its move but it will take effect at the End of the Round.

{{< highlight >}}
In  case  two  Pokémon  are  using  a  Priority  move  at  the  same  time,  the  move  with higher  Priority  number  will  be  resolved first.  In  case  both  have  the  same  priority number, the initiative order will determine  who resolves it first.
{{< /highlight >}}

Take into account: once you announce a Priority Move, your foe may change his order/action to an Evasion, or it may use another Priority Move.

Low Priority is the opposite, it will take effect at the End of the Round, it may look like the foe is holding their action while in reality, it is just about to strike.
