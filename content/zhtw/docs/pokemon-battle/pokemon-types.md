## The Different Pokémon Types
This world is filled with different sources of energy that Pokémon can control. They absorb it as part of their bodies or shape it into powerful attacks.
The Pokémon that is especially proficient at using certain kind of energy is labeled with what we call a Type. 
Until now, **18 types of Pokemon** have been recognized.

Each one of these types has different powers they can use. Some Pokémon are capable of using not just one but two types of energy, gaining the resistances and weaknesses of their second type as well.


### Resistances, Weaknesses, & Immunities
There are many ways to win during a battle; you either use your foe’s weaknesses against him or you exploit your own strengths. A good trainer chooses the right pokémon for the right occasion, in and out of Battle.

Pokémon Types are a common way to gain an edge in a fight. If you happen to choose a Pokémon that resists your foe’s attacks, it won’t be much of a problem if your companion isn’t as strong.

The Pokémon Types Chart can be seen <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type#Type_chart">here</a>.

##### Resistances
All Pokémon Types (with the exception of Normal Type) are able to resist certain Move Types.
**This kind of protection makes the damage received <u>Not very effective</u> reducing 1 point from the total damage received.**


##### Weaknesses
All Pokémon are weak to certain Move Types.
**This vulnerability makes the damage taken <u>Super Effective</u> meaning the Pokémon will receive 1 additional point of damage from the attack but the roll MUST score at least 1 Success.**


##### Immunities
A few Pokémon Types are **<u>Immune</u>** to other specific Types of damage. 
**They will not receive any damage from attacks of that type, but may still be affected by support moves.**


##### Double Resistance/Weakness
Two types may share a resistance, this means that a double-type Pokémon may reduce up to 2 damage points from an attack that is **Not very effective** against both of its Types.

The same rule applies when receiving a **Super Effective** attack. If both of the Pokémon’s Types share a Weakness, the Pokémon will receive 2 additional damage.

{{< example>}}
Josephine encountered a wild **Ryhorn**, she know’s this Pokémon is a **Ground/Rock**-type.
She has 3 Pokémon with her: 
**Beedrill**, a **Bug/Poison**-type; **Slurpuff**, a **Fairy**-type; and **Lombre**, a **Grass/Water** type.

Ryhorn has Ground and Rock-type attacks that are **Super effective** against Poison and Bug Pokémon, and it has a double resistance to Poison attacks. Beedrill would be a poor choice to fight it. Fairy type attacks of Slurpuff would be dealing neutral damage as Rhyhorn is not weak nor resistant to them. However, Rhyhorn is twice as weak to Water and Grass! Both Rock and Ground types share Water and Grass as weakness.

\- “Lombre! I choose you!”- Says Josephine
