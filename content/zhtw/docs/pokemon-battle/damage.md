## Damage
Every time you or your Pokémon are hit by an attack, you are likely to receive damage, only Type Resistances would prevent this from happening and chances are you are getting at least 1 damage point per attack.

If you receive damage, your Trainer and Pokémon are able to heal 1 HP every 8 hours.

You need to minimize your Pokémon’s intake of damage if you want to stay fighting for a long time, otherwise, you will suffer the consequences.

### Fainting
Suffering Damage equal to your total HP will make you faint.
When fainted you cannot move or have an action. You’ll be at the mercy of your surroundings.

Anyone who faints will stay out for an average of 8 hours. After that time, their body will automatically heal itself 1 Damage and the character may regain consciousness.

The item **Revive** allows you to **recover from fainting** in a few seconds. A regular healing **Potion** will cure damage made to the body and may prevent the wounds from getting more serious, but the character **will remain unconscious.**

Fainting is a bad experience for a Pokémon. If you regularly order them to keep fighting until they collapse this will eventually strain your relationship with them by reducing their happiness and loyalty.

It is not too wise to risk your Trainer character to faint in a battle. If a Pokémon faints, it can be recalled into its Pokéball and stay secure until it can get treatment; but a fainted trainer will need the aid of other humans to get back on his feet as **Pokémon companions cannot apply medicine.**

Wild Pokémon will usually cease to attack if the trainer faints and is no longer a menace. But staying out cold completely helpless may put at risk your character’s life.

### Lethal Damage (Optional)
If you or a Pokémon fall unconscious and keep receiving damage, that damage will become **Lethal Damage**.
Some Pokémon can learn devastating moves able to inflict Lethal Damage directly. 

Unlike regular damage, that heals itself over time, receiving Lethal damage involves getting a serious injury that will worsen if left unattended.
If the characters suffer 1 lethal damage, they will suffer another lethal damage every hour until they get medical attention or their body cannot hold any longer and the character dies.

Lethal Damage Moves are banned from official League matches, but your Pokémon may still use them if it holds back the full force of the attacks to deal regular damage.

A move labeled with this Icon Will deal Lethal Damage unless the Pokémon holds back:
{@icon lethal|l}

### Staying Safe
If you suffer Lethal Damage equal to your total HP your character will die. To prevent this, take measures to keep you and your Pokémon safe.

1. Spare no expense in Healing items.
Potions can be expensive but the life of your Pokémon companions has no price.

2. Teach your Pokémon healing moves. 
If a Pokémon is able to learn a move that allows it to recover a little health maybe you should give it priority over learning a damaging move.

3. Learn the Medicine Skill.
There will be times when the potions run out.
Having a Trainer in the party who knows how to find and make medicine out of herbs and 
berries is a life saver!

4. Evade attacks and find cover. 
Pokémon battles have flames and energy beams flying everywhere, find a safe place where your trainer can stay out of harm.

If a Pokémon or Trainer is going to die, make it meaningful, **no sacrifice is ever in vain.**
**No character is disposable.**

### Pain Penalizations
When your body is injured you will feel pain. As you or your Pokémon receive damage, your movements and overall performance will be impaired due to the wounds. 
**This is what we call Pain Penalization.**

{{< highlight >}}
Remove Successes from every Action you attempt,
depending on how badly your Character is injured.
{{< /highlight >}}

To measure the amount of pain you’re in, you must take into account your total HP and follow this simple chart:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>HP State</th>
    <th>Pain Penalization</th>
    <th>Body State</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Full HP</td>
    <td>None</td>
    <td>No pain or discomfort.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Half HP (Rounded down)</td>
    <td>1 Removed Success</td>
    <td>Pain is now hindering you, moving is difficult.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1 HP remaining</td>
    <td>2 Removed Successes</td>
    <td>You are about to black out. 
        Everything seems blurry and standing is painful.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

**Pain Penalizations will be applied to all the actions you make while injured.** <u>Rolls for: Accuracy. Damage, All Social Attributes, Strength, Dexterity, Special, and Insight are also affected</u>; however, **rolls using Vitality and Will are not.**

Pain penalizations will be removed as soon as you heal. If you cannot heal HP, **you can also spend 1 Will Point to ignore 1 Removed Success from penalizations** for the rest of the scene.

{{< mynotice "story" >}}
Pain penalization may be assigned without receiving damage.
For example when the characters are exhausted by exercise, lack of food or sleep.
