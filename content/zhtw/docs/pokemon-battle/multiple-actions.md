## Multiple Actions (Optional)
This  is  where  you  get  fast  and  furious. You  can  abuse your  speed  and  intellect  to  divide  your  attention  and perform multiple tasks at the same time. 

Most common use is in battle; you can attack, evade and support your allies, but Multiple Actions are not limited to fights.

Maybe you want to read a book while driving a car, or maybe you want to catch a ball and kick your foe while dodging bullet seeds. I’m not saying that everything is possible, but you can at least try! 
Worst case scenario: You die.

All you have to do is:

Roll the dice pool for your action.
{{< /highlight >}}


However,  every  Action  beyond  the  first,  will  require 1 additional Success.

<table style="width:60%;">
	<tr><th>Multiple Action</th><th>Required Successes</th></tr>
	<tr><td>1st Action </td><td>1 </td></tr>
	<tr><td>2nd Action </td><td>2 </td></tr>
	<tr><td>3rd Action </td><td>3 </td></tr>
	<tr><td>4th Action </td><td>4 </td></tr>
	<tr><td>5th Action </td><td>5 </td></tr>
</table>

**Pain Penalizations, Low Accuracy, and other penalties may substract Successes from your Rolls.**

You may perform up to 5 multiple actions each round, and it gets harder and harder the more you push your skills, **if you are not skilled enough you risk suffering a Critical Failure.**

{{< mynotice story >}}
When  a  Pokémon  is  acting  on  its own,  they  usually  won’t  make more  than  one  or  two  actions, even if they are capable of doing more.

**You  can  take  your  2nd  action  only  after  everybody else had a chance to act, the only exceptions being: <u>Successive Actions and Evasion/Clash</u>.**

If you make lots of actions it means that you are moving  really  quick.  Running,  jumping,  dodging  and  attacking in an impressive manner.


{{< example >}}
Take this example on how much you can do if you master multiple actions:

Chuckie wants to ride a wild Tauros and text Prof. Oak the information about it. He gets on the back of the Pokémon when he discovers that wild Tauros don’t like being rode. Suddenly, an arrow flies through the air towards him. Since Chuckie is a man of science, he decides that texting his finding to Prof. Oak  is more important, but he also cares about his life, so he will try to do it all at the same time.

Chukie’s traits are:
* Dexterity ●●●●○
* Clever ●●●○○
<!---->
* Evasion ●●●○○
* Athletic ●●○○○
* Science ●●●●○

---

He decides he wants to perform all 3 Actions at once. First, Chuckie will try to stay mounted on the Tauros:

**Chuckie’s First Action** (Requires 1 Success)
{@icon dice|m|4}Chuckie’s Dexterity
\+ {@icon dice|m|2}Chuckie’s Athletic
= {@icon dice|m|6}Chuckie’s First Action Dice Pool

**Roll Results**: {@icon rdice|s|6}{@icon rdice|s|3}{@icon rdice|s|1} {@icon rdice|s|3}{@icon rdice|s|2}{@icon rdice|s|4}

---
He succeeds, Tauros is violently shaking him but he manages to stay on top. Now Chuckie will try to dodge the arrow:

**Chuckie’s Second Action** (Requires 2 Success)
{@icon dice|m|4}Chuckie’s Dexterity
\+ {@icon dice|m|3}Chuckie’s Evasion
= {@icon dice|m|7}Chuckie’s Second Action Dice Pool

**Roll Results**: {@icon rdice|s|2}{@icon rdice|s|5}{@icon rdice|s|1} {@icon rdice|s|4}{@icon rdice|s|3}{@icon rdice|s|5}{@icon rdice|s|2}

---
He succeeds again, moving out of the arrow’s path with ease. Finally Chuckie will try to send the text to Prof. Oak.  

**Chuckie’s Third Action** (Requires 3 Success)
{@icon dice|m|3}Chuckie’s Clever
\+ {@icon dice|m|4}Chuckie’s Science
= {@icon dice|m|7}Chuckie’s Third Action Dice Pool

**Roll Results**: {@icon rdice|s|3}{@icon rdice|s|6}{@icon rdice|s|1} {@icon rdice|s|6}{@icon rdice|s|3}{@icon rdice|s|4}{@icon rdice|s|3}

---
Prof. Oak got his text!  Chuckie, you are the man!
