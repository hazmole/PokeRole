## Status Conditions
There are conditions that change or impair the normal state of humans and Pokémon, they are called **Status Conditions** or **Status Ailments**.
They may be painful or disruptive effects such as burning, or paralyzing.

Some of these effects will disappear in a few minutes, but others can be so severe that will need urgent medical attention. 
There are Pokémon types immune to certain ailments, others are immune if the source is something they resist, but you should still keep some medicines and heal items with you at all times.

**It is possible for Status Conditions to stack into each other**, that means that you or your Pokémon can be asleep, poisoned and burned at the same time.
Only a Full Heal, Full Restore and a Lum Berry are able to cure more than one condition at the same time, if you do not have any of these items you’ll have to cure each condition one by one or do it the old-school way: Stop, drop and roll.

Official League Matches may restrict the stacking of status conditions in Pokémon, for example if one of your opponent’s Pokémon is already poisoned or asleep the League officials may prevent you from adding another condition into it or sanction you if you do.

{{< mynotice trainer >}}
When your Pokémon gets a Status  Condition  you  should    treat  it  as fast as possible. Always carry some Healing Items with you or hurry to the nearest Pokémon Center.
