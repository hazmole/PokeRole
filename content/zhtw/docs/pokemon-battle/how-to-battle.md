## 如何戰鬥
多虧了能讓寶可夢免於嚴重傷害的神奇治療藥水和免費醫療照護設施，寶可夢對戰是這個世界最主要的運動競賽。

寶可夢聯盟也盡其所能在正式對戰中保障牠們的安全。戰鬥是你的選擇，但也要記住為什麼你的寶可夢會這麼做。

寶可夢的戰鬥被分成了四個簡單的階段：

##### 先攻
在這個階段中，我們會決定大家進攻的順序：決定誰先行動，誰排在之後。
先攻順序一旦被決定，它就會一直維持到戰鬥結束。

寶可夢可以使用擁有優先度的招式來暫時改變先攻順序，戰略性地調整他人的行動順序。


##### 戰鬥輪
一個戰鬥輪大約 10 秒鐘。在這段時間內，寶可夢和訓練家可以進行他們的動作和攻擊。一個戰鬥輪會由數個「回合」構成。

如果寶可夢夠快，夠有經驗，那麼牠也許只需要幾秒鐘的空檔就能在同一個戰鬥輪中進行多次攻擊。相反的，階級較低的寶可夢可能會需要花費整整一輪的時間才能執行一次攻擊。


##### 回合
回合是戰鬥輪的其中一個片段，代表著寶可夢使用其動作去施展招式的這段時間。


##### 戰鬥輪結束
一旦所有的寶可夢都做完了牠們各自的動作，且所有一切都處理完畢之後，該回合結束。

**在這個階段，訓練家將獲得進行一個動作的機會。**

有些動作或異常狀態會在戰鬥中的這個階段發揮效果。

### 戰鬥的步驟
#### 步驟 1: 決定先攻
<div class="flavorText">「皮卡丘，就決定是你了！」</div>
{{< highlight >}}Roll 1 Die and add yout Initiavive score to the result.{{< /highlight >}}

Your Initiative Score is equal to:
<div class="middle">靈巧 + 警覺</div>

Whoever gets the higher result may act first, whoever got the second best result goes second and so on.

#### 步驟 2: 使用招式
<div class="flavorText">「皮卡丘，使用十萬伏特！」</div>
{{< highlight >}}Roll the Move’s Accuracy.{{< /highlight >}}

During your Pokémon’s Turn you may order it to use a Move.
Once you have selected the Move, Roll the dice for Accuracy to see if the move hits or misses.
Each Move has its required Accuracy roll on its entry.

#### 步驟 2.5: 閃避/對抗 (可選) 
<div class="flavorText">「伊布，別讓牠打中你！」</div>

The foe might try to evade or retaliate.
{{< highlight >}}The foe Rolls Dexterity + Evasion{{< /highlight >}}

If the foe scores as many successes as you, he evades the attack and won't receive any damage or effects.

**OR**

{{< highlight >}}The foe Rolls Strength/Special + Clash{{< /highlight >}}

If the foe scores as many successes as you, he Clashes the attack and both Pokémon will suffer 1 point of Damage instead of the regular damage from the attack. 
**Weaknesses and Resistances are taken into account when clashing.**
* Evading and Clashing takes one Action.
* Clash also requires the use of a Damaging Move.
* Evasion/Clash can be used only once per Round, each.

#### 步驟 3: 結算傷害
{{< highlight >}}Roll the Move’s Damage minus the foe’s DEF/SDEF.{{< /highlight >}}

If the Move landed, it's time to gather the Dice pool to deal damage. Each Move's entry has its Damage pool listed, and they are usually:

<div class="middle">Strength/Special + Move's Power - Foe's DEF/SDEF</div>

{{< boxmd >}}
**Each success on your Damage Roll inflicts 1 point of damage**

A successfully landed attack always deals 1 point of Damage <u>even if your Damage Pool is reduced to 0 or you score No Successes on the Damage Roll.</u>

If you want to apply the bonus damage from Super Effective, <u>you must score at least 1 success on your Damage Roll.</u>
{{< /boxmd >}}


#### 步驟 4: 下一個！
<div class="flavorText">「伊布，就是現在，使用潑沙!」</div>
{{< highlight >}}The next Pokémon will have their Turn.{{< /highlight >}}

The next Pokémon in the Initiative order will now have a chance to use a Move.

Now's the turn for another Pokémon to follow the Steps 2 and 3.


#### 步驟 5: 處理多重行動
{{< highlight >}}A Pokémon may have more Turns on the same Round{{< /highlight >}}

After all Pokémon have had their action from the first to the last, any Pokémon can try to use another Move during the same Round. For more information on how Multiple Actions work, head to p.49
The order on which everyone takes these extra Turns is the same as their original order of initiatives.


#### 戰鬥輪結束
{{< highlight >}}The Round ends, time to start over.{{< /highlight >}}

After everyone has exhausted all of their actions, all that’s left is to wrap everything up and start over until a victor is declared.
**Trainers have a chance to perform an action** and some Moves, Status Ailments, and other agents have effects at this point of the battle.

### Trainer Actions

Trainers are not only spectators of a battle, and **at the end of each round, they have a brief chance to make one action.**

Choose between these different Actions, each one with its own set of pros and cons.
* Switching Pokémon. 
* Use an Item on a Pokémon.
* Search for cover.
* Enter the fray.
* Run Away from Battle.

#### ⬛ Switching Pokémon
Trainers can spend their action to **send out** and **recall** up to two Pokémon. It is possible to **Recall** your Pokémon at any point during the Round, but **During Official matches you must immediatley Send Out another Pokémon** or else you are conceding defeat.

{{< boxmd >}}
If a Pokémon is switched in the middle of the Round, it will be startled and disoriented as it is coming out from a safe environment within the Pokéball and into a chaotic battlefield.

It will stay looking at its surroundings and **may become the target of an attack.**

For a Switched Pokémon to get out of this dazed state it will need a few seconds to digest all that is happening, this means the Pokémon **will not be able to attack or evade until the beginning of the next round.**
**<u>Switch your Pokémon at the end of the round to avoid this.</u>**
{{< /boxmd >}}

#### ⬛ Use an Item on a Pokémon
Pokémon may get hurt during a fight but Trainers can't get in the middle of the battle and risk injury to aid their Pokémon.
The Trainer will call their Pokémon to come closer and quickly give them treatment by rolling:

<div class="middle">Clever + Medicine</div>

However, this will make the Pokémon vulnerable for a few seconds as **it won't be able to Attack, Evade or use Moves of any kind while you apply the medicine.**
The battle continues and **using an Item on your Pokémon requires it to be still for a whole Round!**

**If your Trainer enters the Fray, you can apply medicine without having to stop your Pokémon from battling.**


#### ⬛ Search for Cover
Non-official battles are chaotic, and Trainers can be in the danger zone where all the attacks are landing. 
At the End of the Round a Trainer can roll:

<div class="middle">Insight + Alert</div>

To quickly scan their surroundings and get behind cover, this will ensure their safety for as long as the cover resists.


#### ⬛ Enter the Fray
They say that if you want something done right you have to do it yourself, and some Trainers take it to heart.
At the End of the Round, your Trainer can choose to be an active part of the battle, **on next round he or she will roll their initiative and have a turn** alongside everyone else.

A Trainer in the fray is focused on fighting, **you won't be able to give orders to your Pokémon**, leaving them without direction and only with their Natures as a guide on what actions thay will take.

**Switching Pokémon and Search for Cover won't be possible either**, for these actions require complete focus.

Being directly in the battle risks Trainers to grave injury.
The League banned this kind of behavior on Official Matches.
At the end of the Round, the Trainer can choose to go back to command their Pokémon.


#### ⬛ Run Away from Battle
You are not forced to keep battling until all your Pokémon collapse and you black out. In Official Matches you can simply concede defeat to end the battle, for non-official battles it gets a bit trickier.
Your Trainer can recall their Pokémon at the End of the Round and make a run for it, rolling:

<div class="middle">Dexterity + Athletic VS the Foe's Dexterity + Athletic</div>

If you score more successes than your foe, the battle ends. Being Blocked prevents you from escaping.
