## How to Battle
Battling Pokémon is the main sport in this world because miraculous healing potions and free health care prevent your companions from getting seriously injured.

The Pokémon League tries its best to keep it as safe as possible within official matches. It’s your choice to fight, just remember why your Pokémon are doing it.

A Pokémon battle is divided into four simple stages:


##### Initiative
During this stage we decide the attacking order: who goes first and who goes last. 
Once the order is established, it will stay that way until the end of the fight. 

Pokémon may use priority Moves to temporarily change the initiative order, or moves that strategically make others go last. 


##### Round
A Round is a period about 10 seconds long, within that timeframe the Pokémon and Trainers perform their actions and attacks. It is composed of Turns. 

If a Pokémon is fast and experienced it may only need a few seconds to perform many attacks in the same Round. A low rank Pokémon might need the whole Round to perform only one attack.


##### Turns
A Turn is a fraction of the Round when a Pokémon uses its action to perform a Move. 


##### End of the Round 
Once all Pokémon have performed their respective actions and everything has been resolved, the Round ends.

**Trainers have a chance to perform an action in this stage.**

Some Moves and Status Conditions have effects at this point in the fight.

### Battling Step by Step
#### Step 1: Initiative
<div style="text-align:right;"><u>- “Pikachu, I choose you!” -</u></div>
<div class="highlight">Roll 1 Die and add yout Initiavive score to the result.</div>

Your Initiative Score is equal to:
<div class="middle">Dexterity + Alert</div>

Whoever gets the higher result may act first, whoever got the second best result goes second and so on.

#### Step 2: Use a Move
<div style="text-align:right;"><u> - “Pikachu, use Thunderbolt!” -</u></div>
<div class="highlight">Roll the Move’s Accuracy.</div>

During your Pokémon’s Turn you may order it to use a Move.
Once you have selected the Move, Roll the dice for Accuracy to see if the move hits or misses.
Each Move has its required Accuracy roll on its entry.

#### Step 2.5: Evasion/Clash (Optional) 
<div style="text-align:right;"><u>- "Eevee, don't let it hit you!" -</u></div>

The foe might try to evade or retaliate.
<div class="highlight">The foe Rolls Dexterity + Evasion</div>

If the foe scores as many successes as you, he evades the attack and won't receive any damage or effects.

**OR**

<div class="highlight">The foe Rolls Strength/Special + Clash</div>

If the foe scores as many successes as you, he Clashes the attack and both Pokémon will suffer 1 point of Damage instead of the regular damage from the attack. 
**Weaknesses and Resistances are taken into account when clashing.**
* Evading and Clashing takes one Action.
* Clash also requires the use of a Damaging Move.
* Evasion/Clash can be used only once per Round, each.

#### Step 3: Damage
<div class="highlight">Roll the Move’s Damage minus the foe’s DEF/SDEF.</div>

If the Move landed, it's time to gather the Dice pool to deal damage. Each Move's entry has its Damage pool listed, and they are usually:

<div class="middle">Strength/Special + Move's Power - Foe's DEF/SDEF</div>

{{< boxmd >}}
**Each success on your Damage Roll inflicts 1 point of damage**

A successfully landed attack always deals 1 point of Damage <u>even if your Damage Pool is reduced to 0 or you score No Successes on the Damage Roll.</u>

If you want to apply the bonus damage from Super Effective, <u>you must score at least 1 success on your Damage Roll.</u>
{{< /boxmd >}}


#### Step 4: Next!
<div style="text-align:right;"><u>- “Eevee, Sand-Attack, now!” -</u></div>
<div class="highlight">The next Pokémon will have their Turn.</div>

The next Pokémon in the Initiative order will now have a chance to use a Move.

Now's the turn for another Pokémon to follow the Steps 2 and 3.


#### Step 5: Multiple Actions.
<div class="highlight">A Pokémon may have more Turns on the same Round</div>

After all Pokémon have had their action from the first to the last, any Pokémon can try to use another Move during the same Round. For more information on how Multiple Actions work, head to p.49
The order on which everyone takes these extra Turns is the same as their original order of initiatives.


#### End of the Round.
<div class="highlight">The Round ends, time to start over.</div>

After everyone has exhausted all of their actions, all that’s left is to wrap everything up and start over until a victor is declared.
**Trainers have a chance to perform an action** and some Moves, Status Ailments, and other agents have effects at this point of the battle.

### Trainer Actions

Trainers are not only spectators of a battle, and **at the end of each round, they have a brief chance to make one action.**

Choose between these different Actions, each one with its own set of pros and cons.
* Switching Pokémon. 
* Use an Item on a Pokémon.
* Search for cover.
* Enter the fray.
* Run Away from Battle.

#### ⬛ Switching Pokémon
Trainers can spend their action to **send out** and **recall** up to two Pokémon. It is possible to **Recall** your Pokémon at any point during the Round, but **During Official matches you must immediatley Send Out another Pokémon** or else you are conceding defeat.

{{< boxmd >}}
If a Pokémon is switched in the middle of the Round, it will be startled and disoriented as it is coming out from a safe environment within the Pokéball and into a chaotic battlefield.

It will stay looking at its surroundings and **may become the target of an attack.**

For a Switched Pokémon to get out of this dazed state it will need a few seconds to digest all that is happening, this means the Pokémon **will not be able to attack or evade until the beginning of the next round.**
**<u>Switch your Pokémon at the end of the round to avoid this.</u>**
{{< /boxmd >}}

#### ⬛ Use an Item on a Pokémon
Pokémon may get hurt during a fight but Trainers can't get in the middle of the battle and risk injury to aid their Pokémon.
The Trainer will call their Pokémon to come closer and quickly give them treatment by rolling:

<div class="middle">Clever + Medicine</div>

However, this will make the Pokémon vulnerable for a few seconds as **it won't be able to Attack, Evade or use Moves of any kind while you apply the medicine.**
The battle continues and **using an Item on your Pokémon requires it to be still for a whole Round!**

**If your Trainer enters the Fray, you can apply medicine without having to stop your Pokémon from battling.**


#### ⬛ Search for Cover
Non-official battles are chaotic, and Trainers can be in the danger zone where all the attacks are landing. 
At the End of the Round a Trainer can roll:

<div class="middle">Insight + Alert</div>

To quickly scan their surroundings and get behind cover, this will ensure their safety for as long as the cover resists.


#### ⬛ Enter the Fray
They say that if you want something done right you have to do it yourself, and some Trainers take it to heart.
At the End of the Round, your Trainer can choose to be an active part of the battle, **on next round he or she will roll their initiative and have a turn** alongside everyone else.

A Trainer in the fray is focused on fighting, **you won't be able to give orders to your Pokémon**, leaving them without direction and only with their Natures as a guide on what actions thay will take.

**Switching Pokémon and Search for Cover won't be possible either**, for these actions require complete focus.

Being directly in the battle risks Trainers to grave injury.
The League banned this kind of behavior on Official Matches.
At the end of the Round, the Trainer can choose to go back to command their Pokémon.


#### ⬛ Run Away from Battle
You are not forced to keep battling until all your Pokémon collapse and you black out. In Official Matches you can simply concede defeat to end the battle, for non-official battles it gets a bit trickier.
Your Trainer can recall their Pokémon at the End of the Round and make a run for it, rolling:

<div class="middle">Dexterity + Athletic VS the Foe's Dexterity + Athletic</div>

If you score more successes than your foe, the battle ends. Being Blocked prevents you from escaping.
