## Pokemon Abilities
Along with their amazing powers, Pokémon are born with special Abilities that define their species. 
These Abilities may affect their personality and skill sets, and give them advantages in-and-out of battle.

**Always consider the Ability of your Pokémon to aid you in any situation.**
 
Sometimes  Pokémon  have  more  than  one  ability  to choose from, outside of battle they can be used at will.

**At  the  beginning  of  a  battle,  you  must  inform  your  storyteller which Ability your Pokemon will use.**
**It cannot be changed once the battle has started.**

Wild Pokémon will always use the Ability that benefits them most in-battle, and the one that’s most useful for their survival out of it.

Effects on Abilities do stack with effects on Moves, such as increasing or reducing attributes, but they rarely stack with each other, meaning that if two Pokémon have the same Ability only one will have effect.  

A Pokémon can make use of an Ability that is not listed on their Pokédex entry at storyteller’s discretion.
Remember to check on important notes at the end of this section.

## Form-altering Abilities 
Certain  Abilities  will  allow  Pokémon  to change between forms. When this happens it means only that Pokémon can make use of  that  Ability  unless  there  is  a  convincing  explanation as to how another Pokémon would alter their form to match the Ability’s effects.

<u>It  is  convenient  you  have  a  character sheet for each of your Pokémon’s Forms.</u>

Each Form will have their Attribute points distriubted according to their rank but they do not necesarily have to match each other.

## Ignoring or Negating?
When  an  Ability  calls  for  Ignoring  an  effect,  it  means  that  only  that  Pokémon can  act  around  the  effect  being  ignored, but everything and everyone else will still be affected by it.

When  an  Ability  calls  for  negating  an  effect, it means thet the Pokémon who has their effects negated cannot access to their power due to external forces preventing it to do so.

## Curse Abilities
Some  effects  of  Moves  or Abilities  may require  help  from  mediums  to  remove them.  If  such  help  is  not  available  you can try to change it with another Move or  Ability  at  your  disposition.  And  if  that doesn’t work, you can try to do it through sheer  willpower  or  hoping  the  effects  go away on their own after a few days...

That can happen, right? right?!

## Hidden Abilities
Some  Pokémon  might  have  Abilities  that are not listed on their Pokédex Entry.
These  Hidden  Abilities  are  the  result  of  uncommon  circumstances  in  a  Pokémon’s life.

It’s up to the Storyteller to determine which Pokémon will obtain a certain Ability. Talk to him or her about how your Pokémon may obtain the Hidden Ability you want.

Keep  in  mind  that  Pokémon  with Abilities not usually seen on them are rare and will turn a few heads among Pokémon scholars.
