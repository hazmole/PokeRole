## 經常被詢問的問題

##### 我可以對隊友使用以敵人做為目標的招式嗎？
可以。儘管這種情況相當罕見，但有時候它仍值得一試，比如說使用**虛張聲勢**、或對擁有「蓄電」特性的寶可夢使用電屬性招式。

##### 我的寶可夢可以對自己使用以同伴或敵人為目標的招式嗎？
不行。大部分以隊友或敵人為目標的招式就是不可能作用在使用者自己身上，比如說**你先請**或**幫助**，你需要另一個目標才能從這個招式中受益。或者，假如你是想讓寶可夢用自己的招式攻擊自己？可別指望你的寶可夢會聽從這個命令。

##### 「脫離範圍」是什麼意思？ What’s the meaning of “Out of Range”?
Some  moves  like  Fly  or  Dig  take  the  Pokémon  out  of range of the fight. When a Pokémon is out of range, it is unaffected by attacks and Moves of any kind. As always, there may be exceptions depending on the situation.

##### If my Pokémon moves away during its turn, is it still in range of the foe?
Yes. Fight’s are not static, people and Pokémon don’t stay rooted the whole scene exchanging blows until someone falls unconscious. Pokémon Battles are dynamic, everyone  is constantly moving even if they’re not explicitly saying so. If you decide to run away, the Battle may end.

##### My  Pokémon  is  able  to  float/fly  is  it  still  affected by Ground-Type Moves?
If your Pokémon is not Flying-Type or harthe ability Levitate, or any other stated immunity to Ground, it will be affected.

##### What’s the meaning of “Ready to Fight”?
When a Pokémon switches in it cannot act until it stays Begining of the next Round.
At that time, the Pokémon is finally “Ready to Fight” and it can act normally. 

##### Can  Protect/Detect/Wide  Guard  and  the  like stack with each other?
No.
Some  Moves  are  labeled  as  “Switcher  Moves”  this  allows the next Pokémon you send to switch in “Ready to Fight”.


##### If my Pokémon fainted, will my next Pokémon be “Ready to Fight”?
Yes. When your Pokémon faints your turn is over. You may send  your  next  Pokémon  at  the  Beginning  of  the  next Round and it will be Ready to Fight.

##### If my Pokémon moves away during its turn, is it still in range of the foe?
Yes. Fight’s are not static, people and Pokémon don’t stay rooted the whole scene exchanging blows until someone falls unconscious. Pokémon Battles are dynamic, everyone  is constantly moving even if they’re not explicitly saying so.

##### I ordered my Pokémon to attack but the foe used a priority Move to attack me first, can I change the order into an Evasion?
Yes. As long as your Pokémon wasn’t able to resolve its original action, you may order it to evade or even use another Priority Move.

##### Is it possible to extend the duration of effects such as Rain Dance or Lucky Chant?
Yes, at Storyteller’s discretion.

##### Can I stack Attribute Increases on my Pokémon? 
Moves that increase the same Attribute won’t stack, but take the higher increase into account instead. 
They don’t stack with Items either, only with Abilities.

##### Can  I  increase  the  Damage  on  Z-Moves,  Max Moves and G-Max Moves? 
If you are of the appropiate Rank, you may. 
Take into account that each Damage Dice you increase will cost you an Effect.

##### Can my Pokémon have Z-Moves, Max Moves and G-Max Moves at the same time? 
It is certainly possible, but it will be up to your Storyteller.

##### If I’m using Multiple Actions, how many successes do I need to Evade or Clash an attack? 
You just need to score as many successes as your foe, it doesn’t matter if it’s your first, second or fifth action. 
However,  your  next  action  WILL  require  an  additional success, as Evading and Clashing do count as an Action.

##### Is it possible to Evade more than once per Round?
Only by using Double Team, Minimize or similar Moves.

##### Can I use the Move Dig to escape from a building  or a cave?
Definetly. However, it may take some time depending on the terrain.
Use common sense.
