If that wasn’t enough, there’s still a gigantic surprise!
Certain Pokémon are able to have something called: The Gigantamax Factor, which allows them to grow even further and change their appearance quite drastically. When a Pokémon releases the full power of its Gigantamax form, a Max Move become G-Max Move that can be fully customized to better suit your Pokémon’s strategy and capabilities.
