## 性格
性格就是你的本質。人類和寶可夢都有著各自的價值觀，而對他們來說重要的是什麼也由此而定。
所有人類和寶可夢都有著獨特的人格特質，但**性格決定了他們在特定情況會採取什麼樣的反應**。

你的性格會顯示出你內心的想法，而這些想法又會反映於外在的行為舉止。有些性格能夠對生活中的某些面向帶來助益，而無論如何，所有的性格在面對特定情況時也都會遭遇到各自的阻礙。

寶可夢可以在訓練家的幫助下克服性格上的限制。即使是膽怯或帶有攻擊性的寶可夢，也能透過適當的引導而變得友好及具社交性。
**寶可夢的性格也可能會在進化時發生改變。**
但對於人類來說，要違背自己性格，就只能透過源自你內心的意志特質來與之對抗。

{{< notice story "說書人筆記" >}}
要記住，人類能夠將感性與行動分離，他們思考或感受到的是一回事，但做出的行動卻又是另一回事。而另一方面，寶可夢則傾向根據牠們的感覺行動，忠於自己的本性。
{{< /notice >}}

你所選擇的性格會決定你的「信心值」，一個你在面對強大壓力時會需要的素質。


{{< boxmd >}}
**一但決定好，訓練家的性格就不能再被改變。**

**寶可夢的性格可能會在進化時改變，或透過訓練而在說書人的判斷下變更。**

在決定你於遊戲中會採取什麼樣的行動時，請把你的性格納入考慮。
根據你在遊戲中對性格的詮釋程度，你也可能會獲得相應的獎勵。

**意志點正是你扮演詮釋出你性格的獎勵。**
當你需要回復意志點時，扮演出你的性格是很好的起手方法。說書人必須在遊戲中獎勵那些忠實呈現出他們性格的玩家。
{{< /boxmd >}}


每個性格都有它們各自要面對的挑戰，沒有哪個比較好或比較不好。
而即使某些性格似乎無法與其他某些性格相處融洽，但這並不是破壞遊戲樂趣的藉口。相反的，這是一個能讓你們完善角色的機會，藉此創造出新的互動和有趣的動態。
寶可夢的性格也同樣能創造出許多不同的互動模式，因為牠不僅會與訓練家建立聯繫，也會和其他寶可夢隊友相互交流。牠們能和睦相處嗎？牠們會彼此成為競爭關係？還是堅固的友情？

當你把所有不同個性特質混在一起，你將會發現這能讓你的遊戲變得多麼豐富多彩。而這也無疑是遊戲中最有趣的部分之一。

## 信心值
人們與寶可夢需要彼此交流，而他們的性格不僅決定了他們的核心感受，也同樣會影響到他們在面對負面環境刺激時的處理能力。

有些人喜歡成為萬眾矚目的焦點，有些人則與一大群人一起廝混，而也有些人偏好冷僻、安靜的地方，或只是單純想要一個人獨處。

**社交場合與寶可夢華麗大賽可能會帶給你相當大的壓力，而這些壓力可能會傷害到你的信心**，而你所受到的這些**情緒傷害**也會給你帶來困境。

如果你的訓練家有興趣成為寶可夢協調訓練家，那麼「信心值」將會是你最有價值的數值之一。
請移至「寶可夢華麗大賽」的章節以進一步瞭解關於信心值以及它的用途。
