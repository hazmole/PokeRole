## Nature
Your Nature is your essence. Both humans and Pokémon have their values and what’s important to them defined by it. 
All people and Pokémon have their own unique personality, but **it is their Nature what defines how they will react to certain situations.**

Your Nature will show what’s inside your mind and that will reflect on the exterior. Some Natures are beneficial for certain aspects of life and all of them can have their own hindrance when facing certain situations.

Pokémon can overcome the limitations of their Nature with the help of their trainer. A fearful or aggressive Pokémon can become friendly and social with the right treatment.
**Pokémon might also change their Nature when they evolve.**
For humans, though, the power to act against your own nature can only come from within yourself through your Will Attribute.

{{< notice story "說書人筆記" >}}
 Keep in mind that Humans are able to think or feel one way yet act another.
 Pokémon on the other hand tend to act according to what they feel and will stay true to their Natures.

The Nature you pick will also determine your Confidence.A trait that you'll need when facing stressful situations.

**ONCE DEFINED, A TRAINER'S NATURE CANNOT BE CHANGED.**

**A Pokémon's Nature might change when it evolves or thanks to its training at Storyteller's discretion.**

Take your Nature into account when deciding the actions you’ll take in the game.
Depending on how well you portray the traits of your Nature you can get rewarded in the game.


**WILL POINTS ARE AN AWARD FOR ROLE-PLAYING YOUR NATURE**

If you need to recover Will Points, acting your Nature is a good way to start. The Storyteller must reward players who keep true to their Nature inside 
the game.
{{< /boxmd >}}

Every Nature has its challenges, there is not one that’s better than the other. 
The fact that some Natures do not seem to get along with each other, it’s no reason for disrupting the fun of the game. On the contrary, they are a chance to complement the characters and create new interactions and fun dynamics.
The Nature of your Pokémon can also create different ways to interact, as not only they get to bond with their trainer but also with their other Pokémon teammates. Will they get along? Will they form rivalry or friendship?

Have fun exploring how rich your game can be when you mix all different personalities into a pot. It is certainly one of the most entertaining parts of the game.

## Confidence
People and Pokémon need to interact with each other, and while their Nature defines their core feelings, it will also affect how well they can handle negative stimuli towards their own ego. 

Some individuals relish in being the center of attention, others just love hanging out in big groups while there'll be a bunch who prefer solitude, quiet places or simply want to be left alone.

**Social Situations and Pokémon Contests might put you through a lot of Stress, this Stress might damage your Confidence**, and the **Emotional Damage** you receive can create difficulties for you.

If your Trainer is interested on becoming a Coordinator, Confidence will be one of your most valuable traits.

Head to the Pokémon Contest section of this book to learn all about Confidence and its uses. p. 63
