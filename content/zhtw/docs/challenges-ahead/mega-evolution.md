## The Power of Mega-Evolution
People  in  Hoenn  mention  the  legendary  Pokémon  Rayquaza, as the first Pokémon to ever Mega-Evolve; but the first records of Mega-Evolution as we know it today come from Kalos.

The  ancestor  of  a  family  that  still  exists  to  this  day,  discovered  how  to  harness  this  god-like  power  and  embed it into energy stones, later called Mega Stones.

Mega-Evolution  consists  on  infusing  your  Pokémon  with the power contained inside the Mega-Stone. This  process will make their bodies go through a transformation similar  to  Evolution,  where  their  body  changes  and  their  attributes increase.

Unlike a normal Evolution process, Mega-Evolution effects will disappear after not being in contact with the mega stone for a couple of minutes.

It is worth noting that Mega-Evolution can be a violent process that causes the Pokémon to be overwhelmed by the  sudden  surge  of  power,  causing  them  distress  and even pain, so a strong relationship with their Trainer is needed for them to be able to endure the transformation without going on a rampage and get the most out of it.

There  is  a  Mega-Stone  for  every  Pokémon  capable  of  Mega-Evolving.  They  are  incredibly  rare,  not  usually found in the wild. They are usually family heirlooms or guarded relics.

They are often called by the name of the Pokémon they Mega-Evolve, for example “Venusaurite”, “Charizardite” “Lucarionite”, etc.

Beware  of  evil  doers  who  wish  to  harness  their  power and create chaos upon the world of Pokémon, for this power in the hands of bad people will bring a destruction like no other.

Some  people  report  seeing  Trainers  with  permanently Mega-Evolved Pokémon. Could the rumors be true?
