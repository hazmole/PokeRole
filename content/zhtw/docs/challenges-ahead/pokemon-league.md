### ⬛ 寶可夢道館挑戰
寶可夢聯盟挑戰最主要的目標就是促使你和你的寶可夢提升自己的技巧與能力。
The main objective of the Pokémon League Challenge is to make you and your Pokémon grow in skill and power. 
To test your progress, the League has eight testing arenas called Pokémon Gyms, where powerful Trainers abound under the tutelage of one of the strongest and renowned Trainer in the region, this person is called a Gym Leader.

They  will  test  your  skills  in  battle  as  a  result  of  your  training  talent  and  the  relationship  between  you  and your companions. 
Their  Pokémon  vary  in  power,  depending  on  who’s  challenging them and how many badges the Trainer has won. They usually focus on a single type of Pokémon.
 
If you manage to beat them, you’ll be rewarded with a badge to prove your skill. Badges may also be bought for incredibly high amounts of money.

Defeating  the  eight  Gym  Leaders  and  getting  the eight  badges,  allows  you  to  participate  in  the  most  exciting  and  gigantic  event  of  the  year:  The  Annual  Tournament! Where Trainers compete and do their best!

Just remember that you have less than a year to defeat the  eight  Gym  Leaders,  otherwise  you’ll  have  to  start over  for  the  next  year’s  challenge.  Get  prepared  and train hard.


### ⬛ 年度錦標賽
There is nothing like the Pokémon League Tournament, this is the only place and event of the year where people can watch the highest level battles, final evolutions and extremely rare Pokémon in a parade of moves they may have never seen before.

Some of the trainers you’ll find here may be as strong as some of the Gym Leaders, although most people get their badges by taking advantage of a Gym’s preferred type. They will be smart, resourceful and you should not take them lightly.

In this tournament, Pokémon Trainers battle each other using  3  Pokémon  in  a  single  battle  where  switching  is  allowed. The Battle arenas are themed, they range from a simple forest-like field to the inside of a house or a sci-fi set. This is mainly to add more challenges for the participants and to give more variety and entertainment to the public.

The semifinals usually change the battle to a full party  of 6 Pokémon in single-battle while the Grand Final may  be different altogether. The Final match always comes as a surprise, and may have lots of different scenarios and added challenges to the fight.

Apart from the battles between Ace Trainers, the League shows  special  events  in  this  tournament  such  as  fights between Gym Leaders, Elite Four and even the Champion  of the region. They are broadcasted on TV.

Their fights are friendly matches and most people don’t realize this, but during this tournament the Elites and Champion do not show their full power.
 
To participate in the League Tournament is a great honor.
After months of enduring hardships, facing great danger,  battling  wild  Pokémon,  competing  against  powerful  trainers, challenging Gym Leaders, surviving in the wild, eating from nature, taming your newly caught Pokémon  and overcoming your own fears; you are finally known  as a formidable Ace Trainer. Whether  you win  or lose, this is the end of the journey for a regular person.


### ⬛ 冠軍之路
Whoever got to the Top 5 in the Annual Pokémon League Tournament  earns  the  right  to  go  through  the  most  dangerous  test  in  the  region  and  probably  one  of  the most deadly places in the entire world: The Victory Road.

This is the final testing ground, only amazingly powerful  trainers may go inside due to the tremendously strong wild Pokémon that dwell in there. This place is a maze-like dungeon, wide as a city, dark as a cave, perilous as war. Here you will be alone with your Pokémon, crawling in enemy territory, surrounded by massive and aggressive  Pokémon gathered by unknown forces. 

The Victory Road can extend for miles and this journey may  last  for  days  or  weeks  without  food,  Pokémarts or a Pokémon Center. You have to endure, you have to  survive, you have to reach the end, and you have to hurry. 
Whatever  entities  reside  in  these  dark  corners  of  the  planet will let you know that you are not welcome.

Going through the Victory Road is not an easy task, most people give up after a few hours inside, once they realize  there is no way of healing besides the potions you carry. 
The Pokémon center is a gift you learn to respect.
Life is short and humans are weak, here you will realize the feebleness of your power as nature is a force to be reckoned with.
Whoever goes through the Victory Road is now in a whole new level.

There comes a time when everyone must look directly into the eyes of Destiny. For a trainer, this is It. The last steps, the final confrontation of power. 

The Elite Four are the ultimate league of badasses and they  will  smite  you  with  unmatched  fury  and  great vengeance.

The rules are simple, you must defeat the four strongest trainers in the region, each of them was able to beat all gyms, go through the Victory Road, and has faced and defeated one or more Elites. 

They  are  crazy  strong  and  wield  powers  beyond  your comprehension. 
**The attribute limit does not apply to these trainers or their Pokémon**. An Elite can wipe a Gym Leader with a single Pokémon and they always carry a party of six.

As soon as you reach the end of the Victory Road, you will find yourself looking right into the lights and glory of the Elite Four Facilities. Within, there is a Pokémon healing machine, a transfer PC, a store and someone to welcome you. Soon after you heal you will take your last few steps and go after some real monsters. Once you get in, there’s no turning back, no backing down, and you cannot surrender, you must fight the Elites until either all your Pokémon loose consciousness or you win it all.
The odds suggest you won’t beat the first Elite, but if you manage to defeat him or her, you’ll have to move on to the next one barely catching a breath.

Here’s the Challenge, you have to defeat them all, one by one, without rest or hesitation. Basically, you must beat their twenty four super strong Pokémon preferably  using just four of yours. Save at least two Pokémon, you will need them to face the Champion.

Sometimes Elites show legendary capabilities. If they do, you can’t win. They are out of your league.

These  battles  are  not  broadcasted  and  there  is  no  audience. Everything is extremely confidential.

A great arena suited for kings extends in front of you, tall and strong, built as a fortress to withstand your last  battle. A booming sound of power fills the room and it’s not a Pokémon but a human, frightening and wise, with an  unbreakable force of will that’s more resilient than these walls.

She comes down on you as a mountain and with eyes that have seen all there is to know about Pokémon and their legends, myths, and gods. Could she have witnessed the same phenomenons as you?

If  you  reached  this  Stage,  you  are  probably  not  an  ordinary  human  anymore,  neither  ordinary  are  the  Pokémon you’re carrying. 
If by some miracle you defeated the Elite Four without the help of a mythical being, the Champion will put an end to your luck streak. 

All  champions  and  their  Pokémon,  knowingly  or  not, are beyond any natural ability. They work the same as  facing legendary Pokémon and their Moves are so strong that they are considered Plot Deviced versions.
They may show powers related to Pokémon deities and demi-deities.  

These  extraordinary  individuals  have  already  proved their  worth,  usefulness  and  resourcefulness  to  great creatures,  allowing  them  to  perform  true  feats  of  legends. 

You  must  defeat  the  Champion  in  an  Item-Holding,  Medicine-Allowed, Previously-Boosted Single Battle. 
If  you  prevail,  you  will  receive  the  Title  of  Champion and gain access to the Hall of Fame, where you and your Pokémon will be recorded to be remembered forever.
Many new paths are revealed as you draw the attention  of  many  unnatural  people  and  unravel  the  deepest  secrets of this universe.

**A Champion, a Master, a Legend. This is only your first step inside the Marvelous World of Pokémon.**
