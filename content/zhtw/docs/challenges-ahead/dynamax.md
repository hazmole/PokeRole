## The BIG Leagues 

Galarian  region  is  home  to  a  strange  phenomenon  not seen anywhere else in the world.

In their wild areas is not that rare to find giant Pokémon on a rampage. It seems there are certain underground deposits  of  energy  called  “Power  Spots”  will  make  a Pokémon  grow  to  an  enormous  size,  you’ll  recognize them as tall pillars of red light coming out of the ground.

This  is  known  as  the  **Dynamax  phenomenon**,  and  it doesn’t stop there, some Pokémon are so sensitive to this strange  energy  that  upon  harnessing  it  they  won’t  only increase their size but also modify their appearance and use even more powerful moves, this is called **Gigantamax Form**.

When Pokémon are under any of these transformations they’ll only be able to use what is know as **Max Moves** and **G-Max Moves** which are an improved version of any Move they already know.

Scientists  of  Galar  have  long  studied  the  Dynamax  phenomenon and due to popular demand, have created a Pokéball that can replicate the effects of said phenomenon as a simulation to enternain spectators and fans of Galarian Pokémon matches!

When we said Galar is the Big Leagues, we mean it in a complete literal way!

There is a catch though, while in the wild this phemonenon can be long lasting, when reproduced artificially with a Dynamaxball
the duration of this powerful forms will be of less than a minute, so make use of all your strength while it lasts to attain your greatest victory yet!

Prepare to see your Pokémon grow in every way, because once you go G-Max you’ll never go back!

While  most  Pokémon  can  Dynamax,  with  their  bodies  increazing their size  (around 15’00”/5 m to 32’00”/10m)  only a few that have been reported to have Gigantamax form; and even then it may vary between members of the same species.

{{< boxmd >}}
From two Pokémon of the same species, one can have a Gigantamax form and the other not.

That’s because some Pokémon are born with the  Gigantamax factor and others are not.

Gigantamax forms are truly titanic (45’00”/ 14m to an incredible 328’00”/100m) it all depends on the species.

The  increase  of  Base  HP  and Attributes  will  vary  from Dynamax  to  Gigantamax,  the  latter  being  much  more powerful.

Neither  form  can  be  sustained  for  very  long,  and  Gigantamax  transformations  may  leave  sequels  on  the Pokémon’s demeanor.
