## Myths and Legends from the Pokémon World
As  you  embark  on  your  first  journey,  **Pokémon:  The Role Playing Game** will deal with some ordinary affairs  and  people’s  everyday  lives,  their  customs,  their  aspirations, the relevance of Pokémon and your own in this beautiful and innocent world.

It’s  a  time  to  learn  about  teamwork,  leadership,  friendship,  camaraderie  and  valor.  A  journey  about  pursuing your dreams, climbing to the top, and realizing  that  you  are  able  to  do  anything  you  want  if  you  persevere and work together.

There is, however, another side to this world. A realm of legends and gods. Beings who molded the landscapes  and  gave  birth  to  humans  and  Pokémon.  Creatures older  than  this  world  to  which  death  means  nothing.  Pokémon who rule the vast ocean, the clear skies or the  wide continents you inhabit.

Famous  libraries  and  old  tablets  talk  about  creatures out  of  the  ordinary,  even  by  Pokémon  standards.  Most  believe  these  are  nothing  but  tales  from  another  era, but maybe eventually you’ll bear witness to something  simply  unexplainable.  This  is  the  first  time  you’ll  be  facing Legendary Pokémon.

### ⬛ Myths
We  know  you  want  to  use  a  couple  of  Legendaries  to spice up your Chronicle, and that’s completely fine. They can turn a simple story into a quest that will change the characters lives, forever.
A  Myth  is  your  main  tool  to  build  up  the  importance of  a  Legendary  Pokémon,  to  reveal  the  first  clue  to  a  mysterious  happening,  or  answer  the  many  questions about this amazing technology.

People’s  eyes  are  veiled  in  a  cloak  of  ignorance  and  comfort. Before revealing the truth behind a Myth, make sure to inspire an air of ancient eras, when gods walked the lands in times long forgotten.

### ⬛ Legendary Pokémon
Despite  having  a  Pokédex  entry,  Legendary  Pokémon should always be treated with great care. When building a story arc revolving around these creatures always take these tips into consideration:

{{< boxmd >}}
* Their presence actively modifies everything  happening around them.
* They cannot be caught or contained in most Pokéballs.
* Most of them should be more intelligent and wiser than humans.
* They know any number of Moves that may match their Types or not.
* They may know Z-Moves, Max or G-Max Moves and even Mega-Evolve at will.
* Some of them may be able to talk, either through telepathy or rough voices.
* There is only one of each. Although some may have powers that allow them to copy themselves. 
* If you wish to take their myths further you may start applying what we call: “Legendary Ranks”
{{< /boxmd >}}

Legendary Pokémon are found in the Pokédex Chapter. 
Their entry shows most of them as Master Rank, which would be their base form. They can be tamed only by the strongest trainers, and they can’t be weaker than shown on their entry.

{{< mynotice story >}}
Legendaries  aren’t  regular  Pokémon  and they are not human. 
**They shouldn’t think nor act as such. All  of  their  actions  are  beyond good and evil**. At most they may be  caring or uncaring.

<div class="mythos">
Long ago, when Sinnoh had just been made, Pokemon and humans led separate lives.
That is not to say they did not help each other. No, indeed they did. They supplied ONE ANOTHER with goods. A PokEmon proposed to the others to always help humans.

It asked that PokEmon be ready to appear before MEn AND WOMEN. 
Thus, to this day, PokEmon appear to us if we venture into tall grass.

There lived a PokEmon in a forest It shed its hide to sleep as a human.
Awakened, the human dons the PokEmon hide to roam villages.
