## Legendary Ranking (Optional)

**Pokémon: The Roleplaying Game** is mainly focused on low Adventure, it deals with the comings and goings of regular people’s lives and their relationship with nature and Pokémon. However, there is a larger mythology in this world. 

Here,  we  open  up  the  door  to  the  universe  of  High  Adventure which extends further away into the primordial forces of creation. These powers manifest on the Pokémon World  in  a  straight-forward  fashion,  but  only  the  most  worthy and brave have the fortitude to comprehend and face the events that will decide the future.

**The Legendary Ranking is an addition to the Ranking System**,  in  that  sense,  it  is  possible  to  be  of Amateur  Rank  and  also  have  a  Hero  Rank.  In  practice,  most  Heroes in the world are  positioned among the Pros and Champions, but  this does not prevent Heroes from being of any Rank.

It’s important to note that it is NOT possible for a Trainer to  raise  or  assign  a  Legendary  Ranking  to  their  Pokémon through Training Sessions. Only a Legendary Pokémon is able to do that, and will do it ONLY for outstanding and worthy Pokémon that go along their Philosophy, a Shaymin won’t be turning a Muk into one of its heroes anytime soon.

**Legendary Ranking  is  more than  just a power scale, it’s your hierarchy in the cosmic order.**

In here we will comment on the most essential aspects regarding the Legendary Ranking, but its real scope will be found in the future supplement: 

{{< mynotice story >}}
Heroic  Rite  of  the  Power  of  One  is simply a rite for communication with a  Legendary  Pokémon.  The  rite  on  itself doesn’t have any real power to grant Legendary Rankings.
Pokéballs  can  catch  a  Pokémon  with  a  Legendary Ranking, but Legendary Pokémon are capable of breaking the Pokéball at will. 
Only a Masterball could hold them.

### <div class='icon Champion'>Hero Rank</div>
Heroes act as the labor force of Legendary Pokémon, usually they’re extraordinary people with a strict code of conduct and an relentless higher purpose. 
Most of them are oblivious to their position as a Hero and the identity of their benefactor. Knowingly or unknowingly, a Hero’s got a job to do and they are expected to accomplish great deeds.

For that reason they have the following benefits:

###### Individual Value
A character with the Hero Rank has capabilities vastly superior to the other members of his species, even at their weakest state, you can tell they are prodigies. 
They  are  beginning  to  realize  that  life  and  power  are more than just a biological composition, there is a greater  power sleeping inside each living being.

* Attribute Minimums are increased by 1.
* Attribute Limits are Increased by 1.

###### Move User
The character awakens to a completely new and strange power running inside them like a far away memory. 
This power is a Move that they are capable of performing even if they arehuman.

* Gain one Move. Usually a Support Move but it can be any Move at Storyteller’s Discretion.
* The  Hero  gains  a  score  in  the  Special  Attribute  identical to that of their main Pokémon on the battle field.

###### Heroic Ability
The Hero develops a supernatural Ability that attaches to their body, it can be activated or deactivated at will. 
At this point, the Hero is undeniably beyond ordinary.

* Gain  one Ability  related  to  the  Legendary  Pokémon providing its blessing. A Heroic Pokémon’s native Ability and a Legendary Ability can be active at the same time. Heroic Trainers may use this Ability themselves.

###### How do I get this Rank?
The Hero and a Pokémon who wish to obtain the blessing enter communion with the greatest forces of destiny.
A Legendary Pokémon will determine If both are worthy in its eyes.

If the communion succeeds it may decide to grant the Legendary Rank of Hero to you, your Pokémon or both.

### <div class='icon Champion'>Guardian Rank</div>
Certain Pokémon are part of folklore they use or used to be revered by humans as Guardians.
On  few  occasions  these  Guardians  create  or  rise  creatures that can’t be rivaled by mortal beings.

They serve on highly specific stationary positions. 
Contrary to Heroes, Guardians can be recognized on sight as beings beyond natural, therefore, they commonly take part  on  legends  from  tribes  and  cultures  all  around  the Pokémon World.

###### Hidden Value
Guardians have a vitality completely out of norm, they are virtually immune to attacks from ordinary creatures. 
On  occasions  this  vitality  manifests  itself  on  bodies  of prodigious size, but this characteristic is not always the case. Their destructive power is enough to fend off invaders or take control of deadly situations that would be too easy to bother a God.

* HP Is increased by 20.
* Max Out all Attributes.


###### All Z-Moves
Moves  from  Guardians  are  usually  an  extension  of  their  assigned duty and they can perform those attacks freely without need for rest or effort, turning even the most basic Move  into  a  power  capable  of  wiping  out  all  non-Heroic foes in a blink.

* Guardians may choose to use the Z-Move version of their Moves, without any restriction except they can’t use the same Z-Move twice during the same Round.

###### Legendary Ability
The nature of a Guardian is augmented to such a level that they are working out of divine energy and not so much because of a physical body. All of their innate capabilities burn intensely, revealing their hierarchy on the mortal world.

* Double the effects of one Ability.
* Guardians may have three Abilities at the same time.

###### How do I get this Rank?
When a Hero has continuosly proven their worth and caliber, it may be summoned by a higher being. 
On this very moment their destiny is revealed, the line which divides the myth from reality will be erased, and just like that a new Guardian is led into the real battle where the future of the world will be forged.
