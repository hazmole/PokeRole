## Rival System (Optional)
It is said “As you get better, more people will want to see you fail”. Your Rival is the worst of those people.

Good or bad, known or unknown, a Rival is always one step ahead and they  show up on your path to remind you that it doesn’t matter how hard you work, you’ll never be as good as them.

Your Rival is more than an obstacle, they might portray the same essence as your character but for all the wrong reasons  or  they  may  be  your  complete  opposite. They are stronger, smarter, more charming, and they know it. 
Along your journey, they will make your life as hard as they can, and they are qualified to get you in trouble and outperform you at every turn. However, maybe, just maybe, if you manage to overcome all your weaknesses, you might be able to defeat them once and for all.

When  you  create  your  character,  create  your  Rival  as well.

#### ⬛ Backgrounds
Rivals are exceptional Trainers with long and juicy backstories  to back up their great skills. 

  
##### Hax0rus
Your  Rival  may  not  have  gotten  his  Pokémon  by  legal means. They are Shiny and insanely rare.

##### Rule of Tenta-Cool
Your Rival was born to be a star, he’s famous with maxed out Social Attributes and Contest Skills. He always tells lies  about  you  and  everyone  believes  him,  even  your close friends and family.

##### Cursed with Awesome
Your Rival has what you want the most, however, your Rival plainly dislikes it and sees it as a curse. This “curse” can take the form of a Pokémon, a Job, an Object, or a Person.

##### Richboy
Your Rival has an unlimited source of money and yet, he will never bet more than $50. If he’s in town, prices are 3 times higher and nothing is free, not even the Pokémon Center. Multiple Richboys, multiply the prices further.

##### Team Member
Your Rival belongs to a criminal organization.
Him and his friends will gang on you to do Battle. At the end of each Round,  your  Rival’s  Pokémon  automatically  hits  your Pokémon with a Typeless version of the Move “Beat Up” (at min. Power). This is considered legal... somehow.
   
##### Disabled/Orphan
Your Rival has suffered a lot throughout his life. People get mad at you for “bullying” this poor troubled kid.
 
##### Anti-Hero
Anywhere you go, you find your Rival’s accomplishments. Whatever you do, he did it first and better.
             
##### Tyrant Mentor
Your Rival thinks he should teach you a lesson.
Perhaps he believes you have the potential to be something greater.
He often shows up to power-up whatever villain you’re facing, lending Items, Healing, giving Stat-Increases and tips about how to beat you.


#### ⬛ Unlike-Abilities
What good is a Rival that you can push around and stomp at every turn? None. Rivals are designed to make your Character yell at the top of his lungs: “It’s not fair!“ But it’s up to you to serve justice. Unlike-Abilities are not balanced, they aren’t meant to be, they are incredible Abilities for the strongest Trainer Antagonists.
   
###### Licence to Cheat.
Your  Rival  does  not  suffer  any  consequences  from  breaking the League’s rules. He may use forbidden Items, send  several  Pokémon,  punch  you  or  your  Pokémon during  an Official Battle, but beware, if you also break the rules, you WILL be sanctioned heavily.

###### OverPowered
Your  Rival  and  his  Pokémon  unleash  their  hidden  power. Their Damage Rolls are always successful.

###### Overconfidence
Your Rival and his Pokémon have an unlimited amount of Will Points.

###### Unbearable
Your Rival knows what to say to make you angry. When he talks to you, you and all your Pokémon automatically  lose  their  cool,  clever,  tough  and  cute.  Any  roll  that  involves those Social Attributes will fail automatically no matter what.

###### Leftover Maniac
All of your Rival’s Pokémon have Leftovers as a Held Item (Leftovers  Heal  1  HP  per  Round.  Up  to  10  HP  may  be healed daily).

###### Cruel Training
Your Rival trains his Pokémon without mercy but they are all fully evolved.

###### Move Master
Choose  one  very  powerful  or  extremely  useful  Move. All  of  your  Rival’s  Pokémon  may  use  that  Move.  
This Unlike-Ability may be chosen multiple times.

###### Gary Stu/Mary Sue
Your Rival always succeeds at everything he does as if he had rolled 5 successes. His Pokémon never fail to live up to his expectations. All their Moves gain the Never Fail Effect.

###### Suspected Thief
Everytime you meet your Rival, you’ll have missing Items by  the  time  they  leave  the  scene.  He  may  even  steal your Pokémon! If your Rival is not Evil, you may find your Pokéball at a nearby Pokémon Center, Adoption Center or Daycare, but if he’s Evil, finding your companion may not be that easy. 

###### Spotlight Thief
Everytime  you  do  something  amazing,  your  Rival  ends taking  all  the  credit  and  even  making  it  look  like  he saved you.

###### Silver Tongue
Your Rival knows how to manipulate you. 
You’ll  do  whatever  he  wants  even  if  it  opposes  your  beliefs or plans. Even worse, you’ll think they’re doing it in your own best interest.

###### Rider of Misfortune
Your Rival decided to make your everyday life a living hell. 
Everything  you  do  gets  unbelievably  complicated,  you have no proof, but you know he’s behind it! No-one believes you, though. 
You can’t regain Confidence and you lose 2 Confidence everyday. When you lose all your Confidence, you suffer a mental breakdown and regain all your Confidence the next day.

###### Double Agent
One of your Pokémon works for your Rival and you don’t even suspect it. They may lose Battles on purpose (modify successes in secret) and sabotage plans. 
They are really good at covering up their misdeeds. This Unlike-Ability may be chosen multiple times. If you store or  release  a  Double  Agent,  another  Pokémon  in  your  party takes its place... but who?

###### Undefeatable Foe
Your Rival is destinied to beat you Every. Single. Time. 
No matter how often you train, how hard you try, which of your Pokémon fights, you always end up losing. 
Every    you  roll  while  battling  your  Rival,  will  subtract one success from your roll.


{{< boxmd >}}
Players can’t be Rivals with each other, Rivals and their unlike-abilities impose an almost-impossible challenge, their skills are not appropiate for Player Characters.

By pure numbers, you might lose everytime, but a well thought strategy will take you far. 
You need to defeat your Rival eventually if you’re looking to reach the Ace Rank. Even more, the Storyteller might want to add new Rival-related Achievements to get to Beginner, and Amateur Rank.

You’ll Love to hate your Rival, have fun trying to surpass this formidable foe.
