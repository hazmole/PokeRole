## 面對挑戰
There are many challenges for a Trainer within the world of Pokémon.

In this section of the book, we’ll give you some ideas and frameworks for episodic tales and campaigns. Use them as inspiration for your games with your friends.

These  are  some  settings  you  can  choose  for  your  Role playing sessions:

---
### ⬛ Episode of the week
A  whole  adventure  in  a  single  session.  It  can  be some  light  hearted  fun  about  helping  people  in  need with  the  aid  of  your  Pokémon,  an  evening  exploring  a  cave  and  its  secrets,  an  exhausting Training  session,  or the search for a specific Pokémon to complete your Pokémon encyclopedia. 

This  format  is  simple  and  good  for  beginners,  simply  create  your  own  encounters  at  a  rank  appropiate  for your players as a way to test their abilities.
 
For inspiration you may take a look at short fables or at the Pokémon TV series. You may even reenact one of its episodes and see the different outcome you have with your friends!

Keep it simple but meaningful.

Everything in the adventure must come full circle by the end of the session.

### ⬛ Defeat Rival/Evil Team
Some people want to irk you personally and others for criminal groups that cause mayhem.

You and your players can also take the episode of the week format to defeat your player’s Rivals or evil teams in the different regions. 

It  may  be  a  friendly  match  with  “Gary”,  or  working alongside a detective to uncover the criminal’s evil plans and bring them to justice once and for all.

It’s  up  to  you  to  decide  the  length  of  the  conflict  between trainers and rivals or evil teams. It may be a casual encounter from time to time or their life-misison to finally put them in their place.

You may find them in one session and not see them again until 2 or 3 sessions later or it may be a recurring theme appearing in all sessions trying to ruin the Trainer’s day.

### ⬛ Pokémon League Challenge
The  League  offers  various  challenges  to  their  trainers, some of them are:

##### Gym Leader Challenge
A novice trainer can go against a Gym leader with the right strategy, while a veteran trainer will have to prove he has what it takes to earn the last badge. 
You can play the specific matches or embark on the whole journey. Traveling to the next Gym can be an adventure on its own.

##### Annual Tournament Challenge
If you manage to obtain 8 Gym Badges within a year, you will be invited to participate in the Annual Tournament of the region. In there, you’ll be given the title of Ace Trainer. You can battle against the strongest Pokémon in the region. Official matches in shifting scenarios with a big crowd cheering or booing at your battle. Be sure to give your best as only the winner may take the trophy home.

##### Victory Road Challenge
If you get to the Top 5 on the famous Annual Tournament  Challenge you are now allowed to take the Victory Road, a treacherous labrynth full of hazards. It is a very long journey through the region’s most dangerous area.

### ⬛ Legends of the Pokémon World
Enough with humans and their affairs. If you want real action,  thrill,  and  danger;  you  must  follow  the  rumor  and lore and go deep into corners of the world where no  human  has  ever  gone.  There  you  will  find  an  ungraspable  power.  Can  you  face  it?  Can  you  tame it?Level-up  your  adventure  with  Mega-Evolutions,  Dynamax  and  Gigantamax  forms,  and  pass  the  legendary hero’s ritual to hold the power of Z-Moves in your hands.

And  if  that  is  not  enough  for  you,  Upgrade  into  the  Legendary Ranks, exclusive for Legendary Pokémon and those who ear their favor. 
Each  Legendary  Pokémon  could  sustain  a  whole  campaign on their own. From a casual clue about their existence, to the greatest finding of your generation.

**Legendary Pokémon are not mindless beasts to be final bosses at  the  bottom  of  a  dungeon. They  all  have  a defined personality and their own motivations.**

You have seen them at their weakest on their Pokédex entries, let’s see if you dare to face them at full power.
They are not humans and they are not regular Pokémon, they are beyond this plane and its concerns.

Are they allies or foes? That will depend on your story.
