## 英雄巡禮與Z招式

In the Alolan Region, children of a certain age go through a coming-of-age ritual where they embark on a journey to commune with their Pokémon and the land.
Each of the four Islands in Alola has a Legendary Pokémon who acts as a Guardian. Once in a while, they show themselves, urging one of the young to begin the four trials.

With the guidance of the Kahuna’s, the child goes through these  tests.  Kahuna’s  know  the  secrets  to  harness  the true  power  of  a  Human  and  Pokémon’s  bond  through something called Z-Move if your get a hold of this power, you are on your way to become a true hero.

Z-Moves require a special ritual dance.

To obtain one you must have passed at least one of the four island’s trials.
