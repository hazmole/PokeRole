## Catching Pokemon
There is a significant difference between human-raised Pokémon  and  wild  ones.  Most  Pokémon  you  find  in towns and cities are the descendants of wild Pokémon  that were domesticated by trainers generations ago. 
They  have  been  bred  and  taught  to  be  friendly,  loyal,  and  obedient;  They'll  adapt  to  their  owner's  Rank  and depend on their Trainer to get stronger.

But Pokémon that live in the wild can be either Pokémon  turned  feral  after  being  abandoned  or  Pokémon  that have lived with no human contact all their lives, this has made them grow their Rank through sheer prowess and survival instinct.

Whatever  the  case,  both  kinds  of  wild  Pokémon  are  distrustful of humans and even jealous of their Pokémon  companions.  Some  will  flee  in  fear,  others  will  get  aggressive and do everything to protect themselves from what they see as a threat to their survival.

Wild Pokémon have honed skills of survival that human-raised  Pokémon  do  not  have.  Also,  there  are  species that have not been tamed nor domesticated due to their  formidable  strength.  Catching  one  of  these  specimens would  give  you  an  advantage  over  the  other  trainers; And they can teach you as much about teamwork, nature and following your instincts as you can teach them about the human world.

### Habitats
The  world  of  Pokémon  is  big,  if  not  bigger  than  ours. 
There  are  places  where  certain  kinds  of  Pokémon  are drawn to, and there are Pokémon that can only be found in certain parts of the globe.
  
Experienced Trainers don’t go around the world throwing  Pokéballs  at  everything  that  moves.  They  study  the  habitats  of  the  Pokémon  and  seek  for  a  specimen that  seems  good-natured  or  try  to  gain  the  trust  and  respect of a Pokémon that seems especially wary.

{{< mynotice story >}}
Some  Pokémon  are  so  rare  that  people don’t know if they are real or legends. 
To  find  them,  trainers  have  to  venture into uncharted areas.

### Special Pokémon
Around the world, there are Pokémon that do not fit their species  stereotypes.  While  every  Pokémon  is  unique, these Pokémon have special qualities to them that can make them literally one in a million. 
Traits  like  a  different  color  pattern,  a  bigger  size  and even moves or abilities that defy their nature.


#### ⬛ Shiny Pokémon, Alternate Forms & Regional Variants. 
Some Pokémon have a different coloration in their fur, hide,  feathers  or  scales. This  change  can  be  aesthetic or it can involve a **change in Typing, Attribute Limits, Moves and/or Abilities.**

**Shiny Pokémon** are distinguished by the sparkles they leave behind as if they were coated in a glittery dust. 
Their  exotic  look  makes  them  highly  appreciated  in  beauty  contests  and  people  will  pay  incredibly  high amounts  of  money  to  get  their  hands  on  one,  **their  appearance does not affect their Type or Attributes.**

**Alternate Forms** refer to Pokémon of the same species that somehow look different from each other although with some resemblance still. **They can have different Types, Attributes and Abilities.**
**Some Pokémon may even change forms at will.**

**Regional  Variants**  are  Alternate  forms  of  Pokémon that can only be found in certain regions, they are the result of introducing foreign Pokémon into an established habitat, over the generations the Pokémon have to adapt to  this  new  environment,  this  can  make  them  **change their type, abilities, move set and even make evolve into something their regular counterparts cannot.**


#### ⬛ Overgrown Pokémon
Most Pokémon have a standard size and weight, but there are reported cases of Pokémon that could be considered giants  within  their  own  species.  **Overgrown  Pokémon  are  usually  around  30%  to  60%  bigger  than  their  regular-sized  counterparts**  but  they  are  very  rare  to find.  Their  main  characteristic  is  that  their  size  and weight keep proportion.

Many trainers have overfed their Pokémon with the hopes of making them bigger, only to end up making them fatter.  An overgrown Pokémon is born that way. Even if at birth it has a normal size, it will keep growing until it reaches maturity.

Overgrown  Pokémon  have  a  higher  Base  HP  than  their regular-sized counterparts.
<div class="middle">Increase their Base HP by 1</div>

#### ⬛ Hidden Moves and Abilities
There  are  records  in  this  world’s  history  that  depict  certain  Pokémon  using  powers  and  Abilities  different from those normally seen on them.
Only a few proficient trainers like Gym Leaders and Elites are known for owning at least one of this Special Pokémon.
However, it is unknown if they captured their Pokémon  with those rare abilities or somehow they worked with them to attain them.

Storyteller's discretion should be applied for Pokémon to  have  Moves  and/or  Abilities  it  wouldn't  normally have.

### Using Pokéballs
If you want to catch a Wild Pokémon, you are gonna need Pokéballs. You can buy them at any Pokémart. 
Greatballs  and  Ultraballs  can  be  more  expensive  than a  regular  Pokéball,  but  in  the  end,  they  can  save  you money by not breaking apart when you need to capture a powerful Pokémon.

When you capture a Pokémon within a Pokéball, the chip  will be branded with your Trainer’s ID. That way other  Trainer’s Pokéballs won’t be able to trap your Pokémon to steal it.
Pokéballs can’t carry Humans, rooted objects like trees or mountain boulders, machinery that contains a lot of small pieces such as motor vehicles and electronics.

Big objects like tents, bicycles, and potions in bulk are sold  with  their  own  Pokéball  for  easy  storage.  Once a  Pokéball  is  used  to  carry  something  inside  it  gets  coded into it and cannot carry anything else. Just like with  Pokémon,  the  item  it  carries  will  have  your  ID  number  and  can  be  retrieved  back  to  you  through  a  computer in case you lose them or want to store them.


#### ⬛ Catch Roll
The main use of Pokéballs is catching Pokémon, they all have a seal you need to roll for the catch to be a success:

<table style="width:60%;">
	<tr><th>Item</th><th>Seal Potency</th></tr>
	<tr><td><b class='icon Beginner' style="display: inline-block;">Pokeball</b> </td><td>4 dice</td></tr>
	<tr><td><b class='icon Amateur' style="display: inline-block;">Greatball</b> </td><td>6 dice</td></tr>
	<tr><td><b class='icon Ace' style="display: inline-block;">Ultraball</b> </td><td>8 dice</td></tr>
</table>

Inflicting damage or a Status Ailments will modify your Catch Roll. These Bonuses Stack with each other, giving you up to +3 extra successes to your Catch Roll. **You lose ALL Bonus Successes against a Fainted Pokémon.**

<table style="width:80%;">
	<tr><th>Wild Pokémon's Condition</th><th>Bonus Successes</th></tr>
	<tr><td>Pokémon is at half HP </td><td>1</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Pokémon is at 1 HP </td><td>1</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Pokémon has a Status Ailment </td><td>1</td></tr>
</table>

Stronger Pokémon are harder to catch, this is why you must score a number of successes that varies with their Rank:

<table style="width:60%;">
	<tr><th>Pokémon's Rank</th><th>Required Successes</th></tr>
	<tr><td>Starter</td><td>3</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Beginner</td><td>4</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Amateur</td><td>6</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Ace</td><td>8</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Professional</td><td>9</td></tr>
</table>

{{< boxmd >}}
If you don't score the Required  Successes, the Pokémon breaks free and the Pokéball is rendered unusable.
{{< /boxmd >}}

{{< example >}}
Leslie found a wild Clefairy!

After a fierce battle, she damaged Clefairy down to half its maximum HP. It is time to use a Pokéball!

She throws the Pokéball and rolls:

{@icon dice|m|4} Pokéball's Dicepool
\+ <b style="font-size:1.5em; color:#4cbb4c">1 Success</b> (Clefairy’s at Half HP)

**Catch Roll**: {@icon rdice|s|4}{@icon rdice|s|5}{@icon rdice|s|2}{@icon rdice|s|1}

Leslie scored 3 success. Since this Clefairy's Ranking is at Starter. That means...
**Leslie caught a wild Clefairy!**
{{< /example >}}

Inflicting damage on a Pokémon will reduce its Happiness and Loyalty; don't expect a Pokémon you just beat into a pulp to be a happy and compliant partner.
Other  Pokémon  take  pride  in  proving  themselves  and handle their defeat against you gracefully.

You may also try and convince a Pokémon to come into adventures with you, no harm in trying.
A friendly approach may win you their loyalty, although some Pokémon are picky as to whom they allow to train them. 

{{< highlight >}}
Pokémon with a higher Rank than a Trainer won't obey commands and cannot be a part of Training Sessions. 
If they were caught forcefully, they may even try to escape!
{{< /highlight >}}

If a recently captured Pokémon dislikes  you, try to be understanding and compensate for it.

Building a relationship with your Pokémon is one of the main aspects for this game.



#### ⬛ Special Pokéballs
Decades ago, to obtain a Pokéball you had to search for a special kind of fruit called Apricorn and craft the item yourself.  It  was  a  long  and  arduous  process  that  took  several days. Back then, you REALLY had to work hard to catch a Pokémon.
Nowdays  the  Pokéball  industry  is  constantly  innovating and offering a variety of products for the diligent Trainer.
These Pokéballs have special effects on the Pokémon you catch  with  them  or  offer  specialization  when  catching Pokémon that meet certain criteria.

**They are limited editions and are usually not found on sale, but when they are, they are not cheap.**

There's is a large variety of Pokéballs, finding all of them and their effects is one of the aspects of Pokémon catching. 
If  you  manage  to  learn  how  to  craft  your  own Pokéballs  you'll  gain  an  edge  over  other  Trainers and save lots of money.

### Other ways to obtain Pokémon

#### ⬛ Buying Pokémon
Pokémon Breeding is a respected profession where people dedicate their lives to raise and nurture Pokémon that aid humans in their activities. 
Many  of  these  professionally  bred  Pokémon  can  be bought, ensuring certain traits such as a non-aggressive nature,  a  good  disposition  for  work,  and  even  special moves. 
 
Buying  Pokémon  is  a  luxury,  though.  Their  cost  range from tens of thousands to even millions of pokédollars. Especially if the bred Pokémon is rare to find in the wild or hard to tame. 
You can also find common Pokémon for sale for a few hundred pokédollars in less reputable places, but it is up to you to trust this kind of establishments.

#### ⬛ Adopting Pokémon
All  around  the  world,  there  are  abandoned  Pokémon. Most of the time they are abandoned for being weak, rebellious or afraid of battles. 
Whatever the case these Pokémon need to be to taken care of. 

Some shelters located outside the cities look after them until another trainer wants to adopt them. Abandoned  Pokémon  have  their  own  story  to  tell  and many are wary of humans. If  you  give  them  respect  and  good  care  they  may  become your most loyal companions.

**Adopting is free for all registered trainers.**
If you see a shelter, take a look inside, perhaps you’ll find the Pokémon you were looking for.

{{< mynotice story >}}
Adopting a Pokémon is a good way to start your Adventure. However, many times they do not have the best attitude or an easy Nature.
{{< /mynotice >}}


#### ⬛ Trading Pokémon
Sometimes a Pokémon was not what you were expecting. Maybe you have too many Pokémon of the same species or maybe you want to get rid of a bad pet. 

Instead of abandoning them, why don’t you trade them? There  are  lots  of  trainers  traveling  from  one  city  to  another looking for a new Pokémon.

If you find someone willing to trade you one Pokémon  in exchange for another, head to the nearest Pokémon  center, put your pokéballs on the machine and wait for the process to complete.

The chip on your Pokémon will still name you as their original trainer but they will be now on the property of another trainer.
 
Be careful as Pokémon you trade will take more time to adjust  to  their  new  trainer.  Whenever  you  trade  a  Pokémon it will lose 1 point of Happiness and Loyalty, even if it is your original Pokémon you’re getting back.


#### ⬛ Releasing Pokémon
There  are  times  when  there  is  no  other  option,  your Pokémon is not happy living with humans or you find that your time together has come to an end.

You can simply let your Pokémon out of its Pokéball on its new home and leave it there,  within a few weeks of not being recalled and not being close to its Pokéball the chip on your Pokémon will deactivate and another trainer will be able to catch it.  Another way is going to a computer  and  manually  deactivate  the  chip  and  ID  of  your Pokémon,  then  allow  the  machine  to  transport  and  release it on a secure location.
It is always sad to see a companion go, and abandoning  a Pokémon for shallow reasons is frowned upon in the Pokémon League community.

Pokémon are sensitive creatures and abandonment takes a toll on their emotions and ability to trust humans.
Be a responsible Trainer and don’t capture Pokémon you don’t intend to take care properly. 
Make  sure  you  only  release  a  Pokémon  that  wants  to  be released.
