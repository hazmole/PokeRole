# Training Pokemon
## Training Sessions
Pokémon  training  is  probably  the  most  fundamental  aspect of becoming stronger.

A training session usually takes 2 hours of your day within the game. During this time you work with your Pokémon,  you  try  to  understand  their  ways,  their  motives,  their strengths and weaknesses. Before attempting  to teach them  something  new,  you  have  to  bond  with  them,  especially  if  they  are  newly  caught. This  way  you  can raise their Loyalty and Happiness.

Once everything is said and done, present your Pokémon  with  simple  and  entertaining  physical  and  mental  activities  like  games,  puzzles,  item  gathering,  weight lifting,  etc. You  can  get  as  creative  as  you  want,  just remember  that  some  Pokémon  may  require  special  attention.

Training a Pokémon requires patience and lots of work. You will need to get better in your own skills if you want to be a better Pokémon Trainer.

You may teach a Pokémon by using your different skills.
 
Once you are ready, you can choose how to strengthen your Pokémon.

{{< example >}}
Tom  has  been  working  with  his  team,  a  Jigglypuff,  a  Lillipup  and  newly  caught  Oddish  and  wants  to  increase their speed, so he’s staring a routine where all his Pokémon run laps.

Weeks later, Oddish has evolved and in preparation for it to evolve again it will need lots of sunlight and nourishment, Tom knows about gardening and goes to a store to buy some fertilizer to treat Gloom with it. 

There  are  many  ways  to  Train  a  Pokémon,  it  just needs a little bit of imagination!
{{< /example >}}


#### ⬛ Rank Up
The most essential job of a Trainer is to raise powerful and happy Pokémon. Your Starter will be the same Rank as you when you start the game, but once you increase your  Rank,  you  will  have  to  Rank-Up  all  Pokémon  you have. Some wild Pokémon might seem weak but with you as a Trainer they will become champion material in no time! 

Depending on the technique used to train a Pokémon,

after a Training Session.

Once you score the required successes, the Pokémon Rank is raised by one level (ex. from Beginner to Amateur).

<table style="width:60%;">
	<tr><th>Rank</th><th>Required Successes</th></tr>
	<tr><td>to Beginner </td><td>3 </td></tr>
	<tr><td>to Amateur </td><td>6 </td></tr>
	<tr><td>to Ace </td><td>12 </td></tr>
	<tr><td>to Pro </td><td>24 </td></tr>
	<tr><td>to Master </td><td>36 </td></tr>
	<tr><td>to Champion </td><td>48 </td></tr>
</table>

**You cannot raise a Pokémon’s Rank beyond your own, and Training Rolls are done only once per day.**
**To fully Rank Up a Pokémon, you need several days.**


#### ⬛ Retrain
Most Trainers won’t get it right on the first try. Considering there are hundreds of different species, whatever works for a Pokémon might not work for another, so, it is possible for a Trainer to rethink their strategy and retrain a companion. Doing so it’s a lot easier than Ranking Up a newly caught Pokémon.

**You may use the Training Session to Retrain instead of Ranking Up. If so, simply:**
{{< highlight >}}
<b style="font-size: 1.2em;">Roll an Attribute/Social Attribute + Lore</b>
after a Training Session.
{{< /highlight >}}

Once you score 3 Successes, you get several benefits:
* Redistribute all Attributes and Social Attributes awarded by Rank.
* Redistribute all Skill Points awarded by Rank. Assign all Skill Points from a Rank, before assigning all Skill Points from the next Rank.
* Pokémon may forget Moves and learn new Moves from available Ranks. <u>Forgotten Moves exclusive to previous Evolutions are lost forever</u>.

**Remember, Training Rolls are done only once per day.**


#### ⬛ Training a Disobedient Pokémon
**You cannot train a Pokémon of higher Rank than your own**. Perhaps the disobedient Pokémon simply wants to do things its own way or maybe it’s is not paying attention deliberately. For whatever reason, you haven’t earned its respect.

{{< example >}}
Christine is just a **Beginner** but has two Pokémon on her team, her starter Pidgey, and a **recently caught Persian**.

They are gathered for a group Training Session.
The  trio  begins  by  playing  Dodgeball.  But  during  today’s  game  only  Pidgey  followed  Christine’s  commands.  When  Christine  threw  the  ball,  Persian quickly crushed it with its fangs and went away to sleep under a tree.

This **Persian’s Rank is Amateur**.This means Christine’s skill is simply not enough to **handle this Pokémon**.

Persian won’t be obeying orders anytime soon.

## Evolve your Pokémon
Evolving a Pokémon is hard work, it requires hours and hours of Training or years of struggle, but when it finally happens, your companions will get a lot stronger.

The  amount  of  training  required  to  Evolve  a  Pokémon varies from species to species. Bug-Type Pokémon tend to Evolve quickly, while Dragon Pokémon take ages.

Pokémon may evolve for several reasons, some Evolve to survive in a hostile environment, others Evolve thanks to age and experience, others change when subjected to materials or energies. See a Pokémon’s Entry for details.

#### ⬛ Evolve through Battle Experience
Most Pokémon evolve after battling quite a lot. If you’re interested  on  getting  your  companions  to  their  Final Form, pay attention to their Battles and their ability to win.

Once a Pokémon has met the required number of Victories, it will begin its transformation.

Each  species  evolves  at  different  rates,  described  as Evolution Time. Follow this simple chart:

<table style="width:60%;">
	<tr><th>Evolution Time</th><th>Required Victories</th></tr>
	<tr><td>Fast </td><td>5 </td></tr>
	<tr><td>Medium </td><td>15 </td></tr>
	<tr><td>Slow </td><td>45 </td></tr>
</table>

Newly caught Pokémon may already have some Victories under their belt.

When a Pokémon Evolves, use their New Pokédex Entry as a Template and distribute all bonuses from Rank just as you would when Retraining.

#### ⬛ Overranking
When a Pokémon is ready to Evolve, you may choose to stop the Evolution by making it snap out of the trance. If you do, a Pokémon retains some of the power it tapped from the process.

**The Pokémon gains access to 1 Move from a Rank higher than its own! This means an Amateur Ranked Pokémon may have 1 Move from Ace Rank.**

There is a problem, though, a Pokémon resets the Victory count to zero, so, if it wants to Evolve, it must start all over again. Also, **a Pokémon may not have more than one Overranked Move at a time.**

**Final  Forms  may  benefit  from  Overranking  too,  once they achieve 20 Victories, they get access to one and only one Move from a Higher Rank.**


#### ⬛ The Limits of a Pokémon
Pokémon  bodies  are  quite  different  to  human  bodies, therefore,  they  have  different  capabilities  too.  Some can  be  stronger,  faster,  or  sturdier.    To  reach  the  full  capacity of development on the body is what we call: **Limits**.

A human has a Limit of 5 points in all attributes, that means that when you reach 5 points, you have developed the attribute maximum for a human.

The Pokémon’s Limits are different for each species and tend to increase with evolution.
 
Even  if  a  Pokémon’s  Limit  may  not  seem  very  high,  remember that all Pokémon posses an attribute that no human has: **Special**. This, alongside the moves they can learn  is  what  allows  them  to  do  incredible  feats  that  humans will never be able to.

{{< example >}}
If we compare the difference of Limits in Strength of a human and a **Tyrogue**, we would have:
* Human’s Strength: ●●○○○
* Tyrogue’s Strength: ●○○ 

This means that even if **Tyrogue** reached its full Limit in Strength, it would not be stronger than a very fit human with 4 or more points in that attribute.

But if that same Tyrogue evolves into a **Hitmonlee**, the Strength limit compared to a human would be:
* Human’s Strength: ●●○○○
* Hitmonlee’s Strength: ●●●○○○○

Tyrogue’s Evolution obtains a potential that not even the strongest human could ever match.

#### ⬛ Teaching New Moves, Forgetting old ones.
Pokémon are able to learn incredibly good Moves, train hard and show them the real arsenal at their disposal.

When you Retrain a **Pokémon it is able able to forget a Move they already know to try out something new. When  your  Pokémon  forgets  a  Move  you  may  pick  a new Move from your Rank or lower.**
However,  if  your  Pokémon  forgets  a  Move  exclusive  to its previous Evolution, it will NOT be able to get it back.
 
Remember that your Pokémon has a limit of Moves it can learn equal to: **Insight + 2**.


#### ⬛ Move Tutors
Some people are even capable of teaching moves that are not usually known by some species. **They are called Move Tutors.**

These  amazing  trainers  are  retired  fighters,  mystic  people or great elders from far away lands. Their secrets  are  kept  away  from  strangers,  but  sometimes  they take  Pokémon  as  pupils  to  teach  them  their  ancient  techniques.

Should you meet one of them, show respect and maybe  they’ll teach you in exchange for a favor.


#### ⬛ Day-Care Centers
There are establishments that give care and training to Pokémon when their owners are too busy or simply do not have the skills necessary to raise a Pokémon. Think about them as obedience schools for pets in the real world.  

They’ll raise and discipline your Pokémon, charging you for every day it stays in their facilities. In the Day-Care, your  Pokémon  will  be  fed,  bathed,  socialized  and  educated.  When  you  get  it  back, **the  number  of  Required Victories to Evolve may be reduced at the Storyteller’s discretion.**

Remember that a well-behaved Pokémon is not always equal to a happy or loyal Pokémon.
