        <description>How to Battle Battling Pokémon is the main sport in this world because miraculous healing potions and free health care prevent your companions from getting seriously injured.
The Pokémon League tries its best to keep it as safe as possible within official matches. It’s your choice to fight, just remember why your Pokémon are doing it.
A Pokémon battle is divided into four simple stages:
Initiative During this stage we decide the attacking order: who goes first and who goes last.</description>

        <description>Damage Every time you or your Pokémon are hit by an attack, you are likely to receive damage, only Type Resistances would prevent this from happening and chances are you are getting at least 1 damage point per attack.
If you receive damage, your Trainer and Pokémon are able to heal 1 HP every 8 hours.
You need to minimize your Pokémon’s intake of damage if you want to stay fighting for a long time, otherwise, you will suffer the consequences.</description>

Most common use is in battle; you can attack, evade and support your allies, but Multiple Actions are not limited to fights.
Maybe you want to read a book while driving a car, or maybe you want to catch a ball and kick your foe while dodging bullet seeds.</description>

This turns the battlegrounds into a shifting scenario, not just an empty arena. Daytime and location can affect your chances of victory.</description>

There are Pokémon types immune to certain ailments, others are immune if the source is something they resist, but you should still keep some medicines and heal items with you at all times.</description>
