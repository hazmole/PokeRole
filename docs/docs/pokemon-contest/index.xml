什麼是寶可夢華麗大賽？ When you talk about Pokémon Contests, you talk about the most profitable show business in this world. These major events take many forms, from Beauty Pageants, to Science Fairs, Staged Battles, Music Festivals, or most commonly, the All-in-one show for everyone to mesmerize at the talent and grace of Trainers and their Pokémon companions.
They are pretty much like a talent show; You present yourself and your Pokémon before an Audience and the Judges to see if your presentation meets all the required criteria; if it does, you win!</description></item><item><title>華麗大賽的構成</title><link>https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/pokemon-contest/contest-makeup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/pokemon-contest/contest-makeup/</guid><description>華麗大賽的構成 Let&amp;rsquo;s go over the parts of the Contest and what do you need to host one.
