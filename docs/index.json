[{"content":"The Different Pokémon Types This world is filled with different sources of energy that Pokémon can control. They absorb it as part of their bod\u0002ies or shape it into powerful attacks.\nThe Pokémon that is especially proficient at using certain kind of energy is labeled with what we call a Type. Until now, 18 types of Pokemon have been recognized.\n\r\rNormal \rPokémon that are not especially proficient at controlling other energies. \r\rBug \rInsectoid creatures that get their strength out of a swarm-like mentality. \r\rDark \rPokémon that control the power of bad emotions and are known for commiting dishonorable actions. \r\rDragon \rCreatures of legend who use their inner rage to destroy anything that opposes them. \r\rElectric \rThey control electric currents. They feed and recharge out of lightning and thunder. \r\rFairy \rElusive and michievous creatures that bring both joy and tears to those who see them. \r\rFight \rThese Pokémon learned to use their body as a weapon. Some materialize their own energy into attacks. \r\rFire \rPokémon that resist heat, they produce and shape fire to burn anything on their wake. \r\rFlying \rThey control the wind currents and are masters of the sky, earth bound creatures cannot easily reach them. \r\rGhost \rBeings from the underworld. They are lurkers in the shadows who prey on the vital energy of the living. \r\rGrass \rPokémon with a plant-like appearance. They feed on sunlight. Some grow flowers and others grow thorns. \r\rGround \rThese Pokémon live below the ground. They can control the movement of earth and all of its properties. \r\rIce \rIce and snow froze their bodies. They can resist and create glacial temperatures. \r\rPoison \rThese creatures carry venom on their body. They bring sickness and plague wherever they go. \r\rPsychic \rThey feed on mental energy to use telekinesis. They are some of the most intelligent beings on the planet. \r\rRock \rTheir body is their armor, they create rock slides and crush their enemies beneath. \r\rSteel \rA cold steel plate covers their bodies. they behave like an organic machine. Ruthless and cold. \r\rWater \rAquatic creatures that can breath under water, they can call the rain and shoot mighty torrents. \r\rEach one of these types has different powers they can use. Some Pokémon are capable of using not just one but two types of energy, gaining the resistances and weaknesses of their second type as well.\nResistances, Weaknesses, \u0026amp; Immunities There are many ways to win during a battle; you either use your foe’s weaknesses against him or you exploit your own strengths. A good trainer chooses the right pokémon for the right occasion, in and out of Battle.\nPokémon Types are a common way to gain an edge in a fight. If you happen to choose a Pokémon that resists your foe’s attacks, it won’t be much of a problem if your companion isn’t as strong.\nThe Pokémon Types Chart can be seen here.\nResistances All Pokémon Types (with the exception of Normal Type) are able to resist certain Move Types.\nThis kind of protection makes the damage received Not very effective reducing 1 point from the total damage received.\nWeaknesses All Pokémon are weak to certain Move Types.\nThis vulnerability makes the damage taken Super Effective meaning the Pokémon will receive 1 additional point of damage from the attack but the roll MUST score at least 1 Success.\nImmunities A few Pokémon Types are Immune to other specific Types of damage. They will not receive any damage from attacks of that type, but may still be affected by support moves.\nDouble Resistance/Weakness Two types may share a resistance, this means that a double-type Pokémon may reduce up to 2 damage points from an attack that is Not very effective against both of its Types.\nThe same rule applies when receiving a Super Effective attack. If both of the Pokémon’s Types share a Weakness, the Pokémon will receive 2 additional damage.\nJosephine encountered a wild Ryhorn, she know’s this Pokémon is a Ground/Rock-type.\nShe has 3 Pokémon with her: Beedrill, a Bug/Poison-type; Slurpuff, a Fairy-type; and Lombre, a Grass/Water type.\nRyhorn has Ground and Rock-type attacks that are Super effective against Poison and Bug Pokémon, and it has a double resistance to Poison attacks. Beedrill would be a poor choice to fight it. Fairy type attacks of Slurpuff would be dealing neutral damage as Rhyhorn is not weak nor resistant to them. However, Rhyhorn is twice as weak to Water and Grass! Both Rock and Ground types share Water and Grass as weakness.\n- “Lombre! I choose you!”- Says Josephine\n ","description":"","id":0,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"不同的寶可夢屬性","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/pokemon-battle/pokemon-types/"},{"content":"介紹 歡迎來到Pokemon RPG！\n這是一本關於如何創造一個屬於你自己的故事，帶領你的角色以及寶可夢前往未知之旅的規則書！\n⬛ 什麼是角色扮演遊戲？ 角色扮演遊戲，就像是做為演員去演出一場戲劇。\n你可以試著在腦中想像一下和小朋友玩家家酒的畫面。你拿起一個代表你的玩偶，並且透過這個玩偶講話、跳躍、開車、進行各種傻里傻氣、或是令人驚豔的冒險。\n這也是同樣的道理。\n唯一不同的是，這個遊戲遵循著一些基本規則。依據這些規則，每個人都會知道自己可以做什麼，不能做什麼。然後在遊玩時，將會由一位說書人（Storyteller）來設計這個遊戲的過程及冒險。\n⬛ 說書人該做什麼事呢？ 直觀地從字面上來看，他或她將會擔當這個故事的述說者。說書人將會撰寫這場冒險、做出一些設定，並且將聚光燈照在玩家們身上。\n說書人將負責透過描述來賦予這個世界生命，並負責扮演NPC們，像是市民、反派角色、以及寶可夢。\n經常會有人誤解，認為說書人在遊戲故事中是宛如天神一般的存在，而玩家只是無力的棋子。但這並不正確，說書人這個身分其實更接近導演。\n他仍然必須使發生的事件合情合理，而且更重要的是，他有義務讓所有人都玩得開心。\n⬛ 寶可夢是什麼？ 寶可夢就像是我們世界中的動物。只不過牠們有著神奇的力量，且種類更跨越了植物和動物等物種。\n有些寶可夢是可以被馴養的、但也有一些太過野性且危險。儘管牠們大多都已經眾所周知，但牠們仍披著一層神秘且神奇的面紗，等待著我們發掘。\n⬛ 做為玩家，我該怎麼融入這個世界？ 在開始遊戲之前，你將會需要創造一個新的角色。\n這就像是創造一個你在這場冒險中的分身。他或她將會是任何你想要的樣貌：或高或矮、或聰明、或貴氣、或稚氣、或古怪。而最棒的是，你並不是獨自一人。你將在冒險中得到許多人的協助：你的朋友、你的寶可夢、和甚至成為朋友的NPC們。\n⬛ 如何使用這本書？ 這本書提供了許多規則，協助你創建故事、情境、角色、寶可夢，還有一些關於這個世界的基本資訊、以及如何展現它們的方式。\n然而，要記住只要你和你的玩家們覺得合適，你們就可以隨意補足這令人驚奇的寶可夢世界的任何設定，讓你和你的玩家能更加舒適地融入。\n在遊戲過程中最主要的工具，就是你的「想像力」。有了它，你們將能夠真正實現不可能之事：在藍天翱翔！從馳騁飛車上跳下！騎乘巨龍或甚至與幽靈交朋友！只要是你能想的到的，你就讓它在這個遊戲中化作真實。\n第二個你必須取得的工具是「角色卡」。玩家們將利用角色卡來記錄各自角色的數值和寶可夢搭檔。\n最後你必須使用的工具是「骰子」。只要有足夠的運氣，任何人都能創造奇蹟；反過來說，再頂尖的人也可能在倒楣的時候失族。\n你在遊戲中的命運，將會由你的能力數值以及一些些的骰運來決定。\n","description":"這個規則是什麼？這是一本關於如何創造一個屬於你自己的故事，帶領你的角色以及寶可夢前往未知之旅的規則書！","id":1,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"介紹","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/introduction/"},{"content":"創建角色 在《寶可夢扮演》這個遊戲中，你必須創建一名寶可夢訓練家（稱其為你的角色），這個人物將會是你在這個故事中的分身。\n你也將挑選一個起始寶可夢，跟你的角色一樣，這個選擇也相當重要。記住，你所選擇的寶可夢通常會反映出你身為訓練家的個性與志向。\n在創建角色時，儘管挑選那些玩起來有趣的內容，讓你能夠在遊戲中放飛做夢、犯蠢、並為你那些最瘋狂的點子盡情歡笑。或許你會想成為某部卡通裡的英雄、或以你崇拜的對象做為基礎來加筆、或甚至模仿某個著名的人物。\n此外，建議選擇那些你能夠輕易表現並演出的人格個性，因為你會需要經常將它扮演出來。\n記住，創造出一個有助於故事進行，而不是去傷害故事的角色。\n⬛ 訓練家概念 所謂的訓練家，就是擁有正式寶可夢訓練執照的人，但這個事實也只不過是你角色人生的冰山一角而已。想想你的角色會從事什麼工作或職業；他或她可能會是位醫生、漁夫、學校保全、一名初出茅廬的模特兒、或任何你覺得有趣的事物。給你的訓練家一個目標，並幫助他決定適合的個人特質。\n你和其他玩家需要決定你們將創造出什麼樣的角色，而這將會需要你、你的玩伴們、以及說書人之間的共同合作，讓玩家們能夠組成一個最好的團隊。\n和你的玩伴們一起完成你們的角色，並一起努力去實現你們訓練家的目標。\n⬛ 個人特質與背景 告訴大家一些有關於你訓練家的過往。\n你的訓練家可以是任何你想要他成為的人物，充實他或她的內在。不要讓他只是一具讓你在遊戲中施展手腳的空殼，而是一個懷抱著夢想和志向，有著缺陷和弱點，活生生的人物。\n為了創造一名豐滿且有說服力的角色，你可以詢問自己下列這些問題，並以你角色的視角來回答這些問題。\n 你的名字是什麼？ 你的年紀多大？ 你的「性格」是什麼？ （參見「性格」章節） 你的職業／角色概念是什麼？ 你對寶可夢世界有什麼樣的期望？  以及最重要的：\n你在寶可夢世界中有什麼樣的目標？ 你達成這個目標的動機是什麼？ 你會如何使這個世界變得更好？  回答這些問題能讓說書人更容易地為你的角色提供他或她所需要的挑戰。不要忘記，玩家們與說書人之間的良好溝通將能使這個故事更圓滑順暢地進行。\n玩家必須要回答完這些問題才能夠開始遊戲。\r 填寫訓練家角色卡 當你訓練家的角色概念準備就緒，你就可以接著分配角色的特質點數和技能點數。\n訓練家的所有特質起始皆為 1 點。\n新角色通常會以「新手」級別的青少年的身分來開始遊戲。更多關於級別的相關說明，請參照「級別」章節。\n特質 青少年有 2 點可以進行分配在特質上。\n你可能會因為你的起始級別不同而有額外可分配的點數。\n 力量: ●●○○○ 活力: ●○○○○ 靈巧: ●●○○○ 洞察: ●○○○○  社交特質 青少年有 2 點可以進行分配在社交特質上。\n你可能會因為你的起始級別不同而有額外可分配的點數。\n 強壯: ●○○○○ 美麗: ●●○○○ 帥氣: ●○○○○ 可愛: ●○○○○ 聰明: ●●○○○  技能 你有 5 點可以分配在技能上，新手的技能上限為 1 點。\n你可能會因為你的起始級別不同而有額外可分配的點數。\n 鬥毆: ○○○○○ 投擲: ○○○○○ 閃避: ●○○○○ 武器: ○○○○○   警覺: ●○○○○ 運動: ○○○○○ 自然: ●○○○○ 隱匿: ○○○○○   共感: ●○○○○ 禮儀: ○○○○○ 威嚇: ○○○○○ 表演: ○○○○○   工藝: ●○○○○ 知識: ○○○○○ 醫藥: ○○○○○ 科學: ○○○○○   ⬛ 我不是新手！ 有一些故事會更適合年齡較大、經驗更豐富、更擅長處理事情的訓練家。如果你想要扮演年紀更大或級別更高的角色，那麼你可以遵循下列的簡單指南：\n\r\r級別\r額外特質點\r額外社交點\r技能點\r技能上限\r\r新手  0  0  5  1 \r初學者  2  2  +4  2 \r業餘者  4  4  +3  3 \r菁英  6  6  +2  4 \r專家  8  8  +1  5 \r\r你必須先把你前個級別獲得的所有技能點給分配完畢，才能接著分配下個級別的所有技能點。單個技能累積分配的點數不能超過技能上限。\n年紀也是一個你必須考慮的因素。就算你的年紀足以獲得訓練家執照，並不代表你能夠在沒有監督的情況下環遊世界。\n訓練家角色的年紀可以比青少年更小／更大，並因此在開始遊戲時獲得更少／更多的特質和社交特質點數。\n\r\r年紀\r特質／社交點\r\r兒童  0/0 \r青少年*  2/2 \r成年人  4/4 \r年長者  3/6 \r\r*新遊戲的基本起始年紀。\n訓練家角色卡 如何填寫訓練家角色卡:\n訓練家卡片區塊 \r  你的角色圖像。 你的訓練家級別。 你角色的名稱。 你角色的年紀。 你的名字。 你角色的角色概念。 選擇一個「性格」，並寫下相應的信心值。 起始金錢為 $1500。 每一點活力都會增加 1 點 HP。 意志點。它的數值等同於 洞察 + 2。 現役隊伍欄位。寫下你目前攜帶的寶可夢們。  特質＆技能區塊 \r 特質。起始為 1。 你的年紀跟級別將決定你可以分配的點數。 技能。你的級別將決定你可以分配的點數以及技能上限。 社交特質。起始為 1。你的年紀跟級別將決定你可以分配的點數。 成就。 寫下你需要達成什麼成就來提高你的級別。 寶可夢圖鑑資訊。寫下你目前收服和見過的寶可夢數量。  背包區塊 \r 藥水袋。 列出你攜帶了多少瓶藥水、以及瓶子內還有多少份藥水。 置物口袋。 放在這裡的道具可以在戰鬥中被使用。 主袋。 放在這裡的道具不能在戰鬥中被使用。 道館徽章盒。  ","description":"說明如何創建訓練家角色","id":2,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"創建角色","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/starting-the-game/create-character/"},{"content":"Pokemon Moves It’s more important to master the cards you’re holding than to complain about the ones your opponents were dealt.\r-Grimsley\r\rPokémon inhabit the vast majority of this world and they protect themselves using wondrous powers. They are able to call upon a certain kind of energy and shape it to attack foes or weaken them; some Pokémon can even use their powers to strengthen or heal themselves and others.\nThese powers are known as Moves.\nAll Pokémon have a hidden greatness that lies dormant. Especially your companions.\nIn the wild, Pokémon will learn new Moves as they grow in age or experience, however, a skilled Trainer will be able to bring out the max potential of any Pokémon.\nRemember, your Pokémon are a reflection of you as a Trainer, the Rank you are in will unlock more Moves for your companions.\nJust like Pokémon, there are 18 Types of Moves.\nEach Type has a unique way of fighting and solving their problems. The most powerful trainers find a Type that matches their way of thinking and facing challenges as a means to be in synch with their Pokémon and have an easier time to bond with them.\nAll Move descriptions were written by the League and explain their use in Battle. However, Moves are originally used for survival and convenience; even attacking Moves. Through these powers your Pokémon shapes its world and so should you, because Battle is just an aspect of what it means to be a Trainer.\nFind creative uses for your Pokémon Moves.\nBasic Rules for Moves  Pokémon may only learn moves from their Rank or lower. Unless they Overank p. 73 The limit to the amount of Moves a Pokémon is able to learn is equal to its Insight Score + 2. During a Training Session a Move can be replaced by another one the Pokémon is able to learn. An Evolved Pokémon can’t learn a Move exclusive to a previous stage, but it may keep it if it got that Move before evolving.   Rules for Moves during Battle  Moves can only be used during the Pokémon’s Turn and during a Clash. A Move can be used only ONCE each round. (Clashing counts as using the Move) Moves that use a Social Attribute (Cool, Cute, Tough, Smart, Beauty) for Accuracy can’t be evaded or clashed. Moves with “All Foes in Range” and “User and Allies in Range” affect a number of targets specified in your Rank. p. 30 Who’s hit by an Area Move is decided by the Storyteller. You may hit your Allies!   Reading a Moves All Moves are presented with graphical elements and text. They are divided in 9 sections.\n\r  Name of the Move Power - Number of Dice added to the Damage Roll. Category Icon - Physical, Special or Support. Type - See The Different Pokémon Types on p.42 Accuracy - Traits used to perform this Move. Damage Pool - Attribute + Power + Modifiers. Additional Info - Most Moves have unique effects. Effect Icons - They are a quick reference as to what the Move does in battle. Move Descriptions - It will tell you what you need to know about using this Move inside or outside a Battle.  Typeless Maneuvers Not every attack is a Move. Sometimes you will fight with simple Typeless Maneuvers.\nSince they don’t use energy, Typeless Maneuvers can’t be used to clash, but other than that they share the same rules as Moves whe used in-battle:\n Maneuvers can only be used on the user’s Turn. Can only be used once per Round.  Battle Maneuvers can be used for attacking or defending, and they also have a lot of use outside of battle. Since anyone can perform them, Humans and Pokémon, they can enrich your strategy. Feel free to create you own.\nStruggle\r0\r\r\r{@icon target|l|foe}\rNone\rDexterity + Brawl/Channel\rStrength/Special + 0\r\r\r\r\rGrapple\r-\r\r\r{@icon target|l|foe}{@icon effect|l|block}\rNone\rStrength + Brawl\rNone\rThe foe is Blocked.\rFoe can resist this Maneuver by rolling their Strength or Dexterity score and scoring the same or more successes than the user.\r\r\rHelp Another\r-\r\r\r{@icon target|l|ally}\rNone\rVaries\rNone\rRoll your Accuracy as if it was Chance Dice.

If the user is Blocked this Maneuver fails.\r\r\rTechnical Machines (Optional) If you’re lucky you can find/buy discs containing guides to teach any Move to a Pokémon called Technical Machines or TM’s for short. Whoever wrote these guides is an incredible Pokémon expert that will give you great tips to get almost any move you want on your Pokémon, it’s not for cheap, though, TM’s prices range from $1000 to $5000.\nWhich Move is contained inside the disc and which Pokémon may learn from it is up to the Storyteller. Teaching a Move by TM must be done on a Training Session.\nPokémon can learn a variety of TM’s, some of the Moves in them will be a different Type than the Pokémon being taught.\r Miscellaneous ⬛ Fling/Natural Gift This Move’s Type and Power can vary wildly.\nPower Foul Berries aren’t very strong, but delicious Berries are quite powerful. Power ranges from 0 to 3.\nFlavor - Type  Spicy - Fire Juicy - Water Fresh - Grass Sour - Electric Oily - Fighting Frozen - Ice Rotten - Poison Dry - Ground Effervescent - Flying Numbing - Psychic Half eaten - Bug Tough - Rock Withered - Ghost Uneatable - Dragon Bitter - Dark Salty - Steel Sugary - Fairy  ⬛ Secret Power/Nature Power The Pokémon absorbs and redirects the properties of its environment onto the target. In the case of Nature Power, the move also changes type accordingly at storyteller’s discretion.\n  Close to a Building:\nRedirect the electric current to inflict Paralysis.\n  Close to a Cave:\nRedirect the rubble to hit and Flinch the foe.\n  Close to a Desert or Road:\nRediret the dust on the terrain to Reduce 1 success from the Accuracy rolls of the target.\n  Close to Grass:\nRedirect the bug and grass powder left in the terrain to inflict Sleep.\n  Close to Snow:\nRedirect the cold wind to Freeze the Foe.\n  Close to Water:\nRedirect a pool of water to engulf the foe, reducing 1 point to their Strength as it tries to fight underwater.\n  ⬛ Relationship between Attributes and Moves As you probably noticed, the effectiveness of some Moves is greatly influenced by your Attributes. Some of them allow you to run faster, such as Quick Attack or Extreme Speed, while others require you to lift certain weight, such as Sky Drop or Rock Throw. But just how fast or how strong is your Pokémon?\nThe following charts describe the maximum Lifting Capacity and maximum Speed for humans and most Pokémon. Please note that some species may lift more or less weight, or move faster or slower. As always the Storyteller has the final word on this topic.\nStrength Chart (Lifting Capacity)  Each point in the Athletic Skill adds 8 lb / 4 kg to the Lifting Capacity. Lifting Capacity is affected by Pain Penalizations.  \r●○○○○ ○○○○○40 lb/18 kg\r●●○○○ ○○○○○100 lb/45 kg\r●●●○○ ○○○○○250 lb/113 kg\r●●●●○ ○○○○○400 lb/181 kg\r●●●●● ○○○○○650 lb/294 kg\r●●●●● ●○○○○800 lb/362 kg\r●●●●● ●●○○○900 lb/408 kg\r●●●●● ●●●○○1000 lb/453 kg\r●●●●● ●●●●○1200 lb/544 kg\r●●●●● ●●●●●1500 lb/680 kg\r\rDexterity Chart (Maximum Speed)  Each point in the Athletic Skill adds 1.4 mi / 2km per hour to the Maximum Speed. Pain Penalizations reduce your Speed:  At Half HP you can only walk; At 1 HP remaining, you can only crawl.   Lifting someone or something halves your Speed, unless you can lift twice the weight of what you’re carrying.  \r●○○○○ ○○○○○6 mph/10 kmph\r●●○○○ ○○○○○12 mph/20 kmph\r●●●○○ ○○○○○15 mph/25 kmph\r●●●●○ ○○○○○18 mph/30 kmph\r●●●●● ○○○○○24 mph/40 kmph\r●●●●● ●○○○○31 mph/60 kmph\r●●●●● ●●○○○49 mph/80 kmph\r●●●●● ●●●○○62 mph/100 kmph\r●●●●● ●●●●○80 mph/130 kmph\r●●●●● ●●●●●99 mph/160 kmph\r\r","description":"","id":3,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"招式的規則","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/pokemon-moves/basic-rules/"},{"content":"Pokemon Contest Pokémon Trainers usually make Pokémon Battles their main focus and it’s all right if you like that kind of crude and violent entertainment, but why would you want to be exchanging blows like a brute when you can follow a lifestyle of luxury and riches thanks to Pokémon Contests?\nWhat are Pokémon Contests? When you talk about Pokémon Contests, you talk about the most profitable show business in this world. These major events take many forms, from Beauty Pageants, to Science Fairs, Staged Battles, Music Festivals, or most commonly, the All-in-one show for everyone to mesmerize at the talent and grace of Trainers and their Pokémon companions.\nThey are pretty much like a talent show; You present yourself and your Pokémon before an Audience and the Judges to see if your presentation meets all the required criteria; if it does, you win! Sounds easy, right? No Damage, Critical Hits, or Fainting standing between you and that awesome First-Place Ribbon. But wait! Just because no one faints at the end of these shows doesn’t mean the competition isn’t fierce but rather the opposite, top tier Contests are full of highly competitive Trainers.\nPeople fall apart under the spotlight. Criticism is fierce, Judges can be ruthless and even the audience can be a tough nut to crack.\nThese are not battles of power, you will use all of your social skills to confidently advance the rounds and earn the admiration of your peers and the good graces of the judges.\nIn a Pokémon Contest you are trying your best to show that you and your Pokémon have the talent, charisma and expertise to give a performance that will astound the world.\nConfidence and Stress To present yourself before an audience you need to be confident enough to handle the stress that comes from having to entertain hundreds if not thousands of people.\nNatures give a specific amount of Confidence Points (p. 38) You may think of Confidence as a “Social HP” that will help you keep your cool under pressure.\nLosing Confidece is similar to losing HP, but instead of suffering damage to your body, you’ll suffer stress and emotional damage. You’ll get progressively nervous and anxious, then histerical. Some will crumble under the pressure of being before an audience and if the stress gets too heavy you may completely shut down, explode into tears or go into an angry rampage. That is what we call a Breakdown.\nAny Contestant, Trainer or Pokémon, who suffers a Breakdown on stage, will be automatically disqualified. \rConfidenceEmotional StateStress Penalization\r\rFull Confidence \rPositive \rNone. You can do this! \r\rHalf Confidence(Rounded down) \rNervous \rAllies nearby will lose 1 Confidence Point each Round. \r\r1 remaining Confidence Point \rFreaking out \rRoll every action twice, keep the lowest roll. \r\rZero Confidence \rBreakdown \rAll Social Rolls fail automatically. \r\rStress Penalizations stack on each other and can only be removed through Trick cards or by spending time relaxing.

Once the order is established, it will stay that way until the end of the fight.\nPokémon may use priority Moves to temporarily change the initiative order, or moves that strategically make others go last.\nRound A Round is a period about 10 seconds long, within that timeframe the Pokémon and Trainers perform their actions and attacks. It is composed of Turns.\nIf a Pokémon is fast and experienced it may only need a few seconds to perform many attacks in the same Round. A low rank Pokémon might need the whole Round to perform only one attack.\nTurns A Turn is a fraction of the Round when a Pokémon uses its action to perform a Move.\nEnd of the Round Once all Pokémon have performed their respective actions and everything has been resolved, the Round ends.\nTrainers have a chance to perform an action in this stage.\nSome Moves and Status Conditions have effects at this point in the fight.\nBattling Step by Step Step 1: Initiative - “Pikachu, I choose you!” -\rRoll 1 Die and add yout Initiavive score to the result.\rYour Initiative Score is equal to:\nDexterity + Alert\rWhoever gets the higher result may act first, whoever got the second best result goes second and so on.\nStep 2: Use a Move  - “Pikachu, use Thunderbolt!” -\rRoll the Move’s Accuracy.\rDuring your Pokémon’s Turn you may order it to use a Move.\nOnce you have selected the Move, Roll the dice for Accuracy to see if the move hits or misses.\nEach Move has its required Accuracy roll on its entry.\nStep 2.5: Evasion/Clash (Optional) - \"Eevee, don't let it hit you!\" -\rThe foe might try to evade or retaliate.\nThe foe Rolls Dexterity + Evasion\rIf the foe scores as many successes as you, he evades the attack and won\u0026rsquo;t receive any damage or effects.\nOR\nThe foe Rolls Strength/Special + Clash\rIf the foe scores as many successes as you, he Clashes the attack and both Pokémon will suffer 1 point of Damage instead of the regular damage from the attack. Weaknesses and Resistances are taken into account when clashing.\n Evading and Clashing takes one Action. Clash also requires the use of a Damaging Move. Evasion/Clash can be used only once per Round, each.  Step 3: Damage Roll the Move’s Damage minus the foe’s DEF/SDEF.\rIf the Move landed, it\u0026rsquo;s time to gather the Dice pool to deal damage. Each Move\u0026rsquo;s entry has its Damage pool list\u0002ed, and they are usually:\nStrength/Special + Move's Power - Foe's DEF/SDEF\rEach success on your Damage Roll inflicts 1 point of damage\nA successfully landed attack always deals 1 point of Damage even if your Damage Pool is reduced to 0 or you score No Successes on the Damage Roll.\nIf you want to apply the bonus damage from Super Effective, you must score at least 1 success on your Damage Roll.\n Step 4: Next! - “Eevee, Sand-Attack, now!” -\rThe next Pokémon will have their Turn.\rThe next Pokémon in the Initiative order will now have a chance to use a Move.\nNow\u0026rsquo;s the turn for another Pokémon to follow the Steps 2 and 3.\nStep 5: Multiple Actions. A Pokémon may have more Turns on the same Round\rAfter all Pokémon have had their action from the first to the last, any Pokémon can try to use another Move during the same Round. For more information on how Multiple Actions work, head to p.49\nThe order on which everyone takes these extra Turns is the same as their original order of initiatives.\nEnd of the Round. The Round ends, time to start over.\rAfter everyone has exhausted all of their actions, all that’s left is to wrap everything up and start over until a victor is declared.\nTrainers have a chance to perform an action and some Moves, Status Ailments, and other agents have effects at this point of the battle.\nTrainer Actions Trainers are not only spectators of a battle, and at the end of each round, they have a brief chance to make one action.\nChoose between these different Actions, each one with its own set of pros and cons.\n Switching Pokémon. Use an Item on a Pokémon. Search for cover. Enter the fray. Run Away from Battle.  ⬛ Switching Pokémon Trainers can spend their action to send out and recall up to two Pokémon. It is possible to Recall your Pokémon at any point during the Round, but During Official matches you must immediatley Send Out another Pokémon or else you are conceding defeat.\nIf a Pokémon is switched in the middle of the Round, it will be startled and disoriented as it is coming out from a safe environment within the Pokéball and into a chaotic battlefield.\nIt will stay looking at its surroundings and may become the target of an attack.\nFor a Switched Pokémon to get out of this dazed state it will need a few seconds to digest all that is happening, this means the Pokémon will not be able to attack or evade until the beginning of the next round.\nSwitch your Pokémon at the end of the round to avoid this.\n ⬛ Use an Item on a Pokémon Pokémon may get hurt during a fight but Trainers can\u0026rsquo;t get in the middle of the battle and risk injury to aid their Pokémon.\nThe Trainer will call their Pokémon to come closer and quickly give them treatment by rolling:\nClever + Medicine\rHowever, this will make the Pokémon vulnerable for a few seconds as it won\u0026rsquo;t be able to Attack, Evade or use Moves of any kind while you apply the medicine.\nThe battle continues and using an Item on your Pokémon requires it to be still for a whole Round!\nIf your Trainer enters the Fray, you can apply medicine without having to stop your Pokémon from battling.\n⬛ Search for Cover Non-official battles are chaotic, and Trainers can be in the danger zone where all the attacks are landing. At the End of the Round a Trainer can roll:\nInsight + Alert\rTo quickly scan their surroundings and get behind cover, this will ensure their safety for as long as the cover resists.\n⬛ Enter the Fray They say that if you want something done right you have to do it yourself, and some Trainers take it to heart.\nAt the End of the Round, your Trainer can choose to be an active part of the battle, on next round he or she will roll their initiative and have a turn alongside everyone else.\nA Trainer in the fray is focused on fighting, you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to give orders to your Pokémon, leaving them without direction and only with their Natures as a guide on what actions thay will take.\nSwitching Pokémon and Search for Cover won\u0026rsquo;t be possible either, for these actions require complete focus.\nBeing directly in the battle risks Trainers to grave injury.\nThe League banned this kind of behavior on Official Matches.\nAt the end of the Round, the Trainer can choose to go back to command their Pokémon.\n⬛ Run Away from Battle You are not forced to keep battling until all your Pokémon collapse and you black out. In Official Matches you can simply concede defeat to end the battle, for non-official battles it gets a bit trickier.\nYour Trainer can recall their Pokémon at the End of the Round and make a run for it, rolling:\nDexterity + Athletic VS the Foe's Dexterity + Athletic\rIf you score more successes than your foe, the battle ends. Being Blocked prevents you from escaping.\n","description":"","id":6,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"如何戰鬥","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/pokemon-battle/how-to-battle/"},{"content":"Effect Icons There are many Icons in this Move Encyclopedia.

在這世界中生活的人們與你我無異。他們有家庭和朋友，也同樣追求著財富、愛情、名聲、和平以及刺激。\n然而，他們的世界與我們有許多不同：其中，寶可夢的存在幾乎改變了所有事物。\n在這個世界裡，許多人遊走旅行在各個地區，尋求著冒險、神祕，以及成為頂尖的機會。\n城市的數量較為稀少且相距甚遠，但小型的城鎮倒是相當常見。他們某方面的科技相當進步，但也有些方面看起來已經過時。\n如果你想要冒險前往其他地區，你將會需要寶可夢來保護你遠離各種旅途上的危險。\n為了讓你更容易理解寶可夢世界中的危險，讓我們換一個觀點來看：\n鱷魚是種很危險的生物，對吧？\n那麼，試著想像有一隻鱷魚，牠的速度迅捷如獵豹，還能從口中射出光束、眼睛發出閃光！\n如果這樣對你來說還不夠危險，那麼就準備好跳上那無法控制的命運列車軌道吧！你所採取的每一步，以及每一個在你旅途中出現的生物，都有著他自己的故事。\n僅僅是離開城鎮幾哩之遙都有可能導致無數麻煩，但也可能會讓你經歷世界上最令人興奮的故事。\n但等等！這個遊戲並不只是你而已，而是你和你的寵物！\n你是否曾經覺得你的狗狗想要保護你遠離某些東西？ 像是，就算一切都亂了套而危險逐步靠近的時候，你總會有個小小守護者在你身邊，保護你平安歸家。這就是這個遊戲的精髓。 一場你、你忠誠的狗狗、伶俐的貓咪、以及傻氣的鳥兒共同交織的，令人雀躍的旅途。\n口袋怪獸 生活在這個世界的生物都有著不可思議的力量。牠們形體各異，大小不同，且從創世以來就棲息在這個世界上。牠們有些早已絕種，而有些則是在近代才被發現。\n在人類出現之初，這些生物中最古老而強大的個體們統治著這個世界。一開始，人類畏懼牠們。然而在數個世紀之後，人類和這些生物如今共同生活在一起，互相建立起了信任及忠誠的羈絆。\n人們學會了如何將這些生物安全地存放在一個口袋大小的裝置中，並能在需要的時候將其放出。這項技術帶給了這些神祕生物牠們現在的名字：「口袋怪獸」，簡稱「寶可夢」。\n而這也正是宣告了這革命性概念的開始。\n現在，人們能收服這些生物，安全地與牠們互動，並利用牠們特殊的能力來改變這個世界。透過這股力量，許多人出發展開了偉大的冒險，嘗試收服所有的寶可夢。\n儘管如此，寶可夢的世界仍然屬於寶可夢，且其大部分的奧秘也尚未被解開。\n⬛ 寶可夢的進化 寶可夢有著特別的神奇力量，牠們能透過一種快速且戲劇性的變化，來變得更大、更快且更強壯。\n這些現象被稱為「進化」，且大部分的寶可夢都能夠發生這樣的現象。\n這個變化的發生有許多種不同的原因，最常見的情形是寶可夢成長到了足以讓他進化的階段。\n除此之外，接觸不同種類的能量、細心地呵護、身體的鍛鍊、或是嚴峻的環境都可能是寶可夢進化的契機。\n也有一些報告指出，即使有些寶可夢的物種是能夠進化的，但仍有個體終其一生都不會經歷這樣的變化。關於這個現象的研究仍然有很長一段路要走。\n值得注意的是，許多寶可夢的行為舉止在進化之後也會跟著改變。\n有些寶可夢會在獲得更強的力量之後變得叛逆或重拾野性；也有些會變得更認真、更大膽、或更狂暴。只有最熟練的專家才能夠駕馭完全進化的寶可夢。\n寶可夢世界中的生活 人們對這個世界的起源有著許多不同的理論和傳說。儘管沒有任何一個能被證實，但一個不可否認的事實是：寶可夢從一開始就已經存在。\n牠們在史前時代自在遊蕩，棲居於陸地、海洋與天空，爭奪著食物與領土。現今發現的化石描繪出了那人類還未出現的遙遠過去，為我們展現著那些已經滅絕的寶可夢、以及牠們的生活方式。\n當第一批人類開始定居時，那些較為溫和的物種來到他們的身邊尋求庇護，並建立了一種基於共同生存意志的緊密、互惠的羈絆。\n而這種羈絆就這麼一直延續到了今日。\n由於廣泛使用了高科技裝置以及古老的替代品，現代寶可夢世界看起來或許有些矛盾。\n然而首先要記得，這並不是人類的世界。與寶可夢相比，人類是如此稀少且孱弱，以至於無法真正成為這個世界的優勢物種。其次，人類所有的科學和技術成就全都是倚靠寶可夢的協助而發展起來的。\n這個世界的人們並未發現如何生起火焰，也沒有駕馭發電的方式。他們只是單純借助火系和電系寶可夢的幫助。\n這就是為什麼這個世界的某些科技能有飛躍性的發展，但整體社會卻沒有足夠都市化的原因。\n人們享受著簡單的生活，因為他們只需要從大自然獲取所需，而不需要承擔太多的風險。\n他們不需要太多的奢侈品、假期、複雜的經濟體系、或是強大的執法機關。\n然而，人們確實發展出了卓越的醫療系統以及豐富的醫療知識。能夠治療傷口和疾病的「靈丹妙藥」比比皆是。\n雖然這樣的治療技術似乎很常見，但沒有人真的知道這些藥物是從何而來，也沒有人知道這些常用的技術究竟是誰發明的。\n⬛ 人們與寶可夢之間的互動 在近代，人類居住區與寶可夢之間的分界可謂非常薄弱，但即使生活圈如此接近，大多數人類還是會選擇把自己安全地隔離在城鎮和城市裡頭，只讓少數無害的寶可夢在裡頭游蕩。\n世界上那些最為狂野的寶可夢往往隱居在遠離人煙的地方。如果有人膽敢侵入，野生寶可夢將會極力捍衛牠們的領土。也因此，人們往往傾向讓已經馴化或是由人類養大的寶可夢待在身邊，讓自己能過上更輕鬆的生活。\n你在城鎮中所見到的寶可夢通常被用來保護人們、或是協助各式各樣的工作，其他有些則是作為家庭寵物，而也有些寶可夢會被那些最為邪惡的惡黨當作武器來使用。\n投身於捕捉、馴服、和教導這些生物如何與人類共同生活的人們，被稱為寶可夢訓練家。\n寶可夢訓練家的生態與於職業運動員有些相似。他們最主要的活動被稱為「寶可夢對戰」，主要目標在於利用寶可夢自身強大的能力與技能擊敗對方的寶可夢。\n為了規範與約束這個職業，寶可夢聯盟 成立了。\n主要地區 就像我們的世界一樣，寶可夢世界劃分了許多不同的地區，且每個地區就是一個完整的國家。然而，這些國家並不是以實際的陸地或海洋做為分界，而是按照寶可夢聯盟來劃分的。\n不過還是有例外存在：關都地區與城都地區被湊在了一塊，並共享著一部份的寶可夢聯盟賽制。除此之外的其他地區都有著自己的聯盟挑戰賽、寶可夢品種、著名訓練家、和其他獨特事物。\n能在某個區域被輕易找到的寶可夢，在其他地區也許就罕見。這也是為什麼寶可夢訓練家很多都是環遊世界的旅行者，他們前往不同的地區四處探險，尋找是否有不一樣的寶可夢存在。\n\r ⬛ 關都地區 Kanto 關都地區 與現代日本相當類似。這裡是科技的搖籃，也是世界知名的西爾佛（Silph）公司總部和寶可夢聯盟的誕生地。\n在這個地區，寶可夢戰鬥不只是一種全國性的運動，更是他們的生活方式。\n關都寶可夢聯盟的組織非常龐大，因此也負責了城都地區的聯盟賽註冊事宜。這是一個充滿強大訓練家、豐富多彩的地區。\n⬛ 城都地區 Johto 城都地區與關都地區相鄰。這是一個古老的地區，城鎮稀少分散，而且大城市很少。\n城都地區充滿了許多神廟和傳說。儘管這裡的生活古樸，但他是個相當和平且適合居住的地方。這裡同時也是 阿露福遺跡（the Ruin\u0026rsquo;s of Alph）的所在地：一座少有人膽敢深入探索的神秘城市遺跡。\n⬛ 豐緣地區 Hoenn 這是一個彼此關係豐沛而密切的地區。人們與自然和平相處，且人類與各種寶可夢都能和睦共存。豐緣地區由許多島嶼組成，而這些島嶼了提供豐富多樣的自然環境。\n據說有許多奇景隱藏在深海之中，以及煙囪山的中心。\n⬛ 神奧地區 Sinnoh 傳說神奧是第一個被眾神創造的地區，或許這也正是這裡帶有神秘與雄偉氛圍的原因。\n神奧地區是著名的冠軍「竹蘭」的出生地，這名女性深入探索著傳說領域，尋找著關於這個世界起源的真相。據說在這個地區的某處存在著通往另一個恐怖世界的傳送門。\n⬛ 合眾地區 Unova 遠離所有其他地區，合眾地區保有一些世界上最奇異特別的寶可夢。這是一個壯觀宏偉的地區，有著現代化的大城市以及優秀的交通系統：火車以及機場，這在其他的地區非常罕見。\n然而要多加留意，這個地區偶爾會傳出有奇怪的寶可夢引發各種自然災害的消息。\n⬛ 卡洛斯地區 Kalos 卡洛斯是一個發達的工業地區，富有是這裡的代名詞。這個地區的人們已經發展出了一個有著現代化環境與高生活品質的國家。\n卡洛斯地區同時也是地理範圍最大的一個地區，許許多多的人們和寶可夢居住於此。密阿雷市是你必去的著名旅遊景點之一：一座被金黃鵝卵石覆蓋的美麗都市，還有一座高聳的棱柱塔矗立在城市的中心點。\n⬛ 阿羅拉地區 Alola 這個地區是由數個小型島嶼群組成，且直到最近才成立了自己的寶可夢聯盟。這些天堂般的島嶼富含令人驚豔的旅遊景點和當地文化。這裡有著相當豐富的文化與傳說，居民們看待寶可夢們的方式也更接近魔法生物。這同時體現在了他們對聯盟挑戰的態度、以及他們與島嶼上關於「守護神寶可夢」傳說和神話之間的特殊聯繫上。\n⬛ 伽勒爾地區 Galar 伽勒爾地區的人民為他們的歷史與文化而自豪：他們的戰士、騎士和國王在古代戰爭中團結一致並取得了勝利。而他們的遺志至今依然存在於伽勒爾人那無與倫比的戰鬥精神和競爭力之中。\n寶可夢聯盟就是這裡的一切，聯盟賽的每一場戰鬥都是一場盛大的體育賽事，在賽場中到處都是粉絲、觀眾、贊助商、和營銷人員。在伽勒爾，寶可夢戰鬥能夠帶來相當巨大的利益。\n寶可夢聯盟 寶可夢聯盟是一個規範人們與寶可夢之間互動關係的組織，他們負責發放許可持有和指揮寶可夢的執照。寶可夢聯盟是這個世界最高的權威組織，且他們旗下的訓練家和飼育員提供寶可夢們以協助建造一個繁榮和平的世界。\n在寶可夢聯盟存在以前，對於那些濫用寶可夢以傷害他人、或為自己私利謀取權力的壞人，人們並沒有任何規則或法律可以用來保護自己。寶可夢之間的對戰有可能變得相當危險，因此，寶可夢聯盟組織被創立，以求在這個混亂的情境中建立起秩序。\n在地區中成立寶可夢聯盟能帶來許多好處，該地區的居民將能夠在寶可夢訓練家的幫助下得到寶可夢的協助，他們也能期待聯盟透過寶可夢中心為城鎮提供現代化的醫療保健設施。\n寶可夢聯盟同時也提供了像是道館挑戰賽和年度錦標賽等賽事讓所有訓練家挑戰，來自該地區各處的人們將聚集在賽場，觀賞著訓練家們、四天王、和冠軍彼此之間激盪出最精彩的高水準戰鬥。\n寶可夢聯盟 訓練家守則 基本守則  你必須擁有寶可夢聯盟的執照，才能訓練寶可夢或是參加任何由聯盟舉辦的挑戰賽及競賽。 你必須對自己寶可夢的行為負責。 任何寶可夢都有權利開開心心的。 你不能擁有沒被精靈球收服的寶可夢。 你最多只能隨身攜帶六隻寶可夢。 你只能使用聯盟官方的寶可夢交換機器來進行寶可夢的交換。  對戰守則  你只能挑戰其他擁有執照的訓練家。 如果你受到進行官方聯盟對戰的挑戰，則你有義務接受挑戰。 你可以利用寶可夢對戰做為解決爭議的手段，輸家必須要讓步至少24小時。 你有權挑戰道館館主，且每個道館館主都有義務接受你的挑戰。 由挑戰者先行選擇出戰的寶可夢。唯一的例外是道館館主和四天王，他們永遠必須先行選擇出戰的寶可夢。 你不能在對戰中同時使用超過一隻的寶可夢。雙打對戰是例外，在雙打對戰中你不能同時使用超過兩隻的寶可夢。 你不能在正式寶可夢對戰中使用藥品，除非所有參與對戰的訓練家都已經在事先達成協議。 嚴禁在任何類型的寶可夢對戰中讓你的寶可夢持用任何非官方的武器或物品。 嚴禁以全力施放可能會導致寶可夢死亡的招式。 嚴禁更改招式的正式名稱。 嚴禁給出混淆的指令來欺騙你的對手。 嚴禁在正式對戰中打斷或攻擊訓練家。  福利  任何透過讓其寶可夢為社會服務或推廣寶可夢訓練家良好形象來幫助社群的訓練家，寶可夢聯盟都將給予表彰。 正式寶可夢對戰永遠會根據訓練家之間的事前協議以獎金方式獎勵贏家。若沒有事前協議，則獎金為輸家身上一半的金錢。 你有權利免費使用任何寶可夢聯盟的設施。  懲處 違反任何寶可夢聯盟所訂定的規則，無論是否故意，都會遭到寶可夢聯盟當局的懲處。\n 根據違規行為，懲處可能會從最輕 5,000 元罰金和社區服務，到最嚴重吊銷或撤除訓練家執照。 請注意，寶可夢聯盟與警察機關是兩個獨立的機構。違反其中一方的規定並不會影響到另一方。  任何註冊訓練家的違規行為都會被通報給寶可夢聯盟。我們總是會知道。\n若要瞭解更多資訊，請聯絡當地的寶可夢中心，或致電 (555) 0123 - PKMN\r寶可夢聯盟總部，冠軍之路#001 郵政號碼：09876\r\r ⬛ 寶可夢中心 面對寶可夢世界中潛藏的許多危險，所有離鄉旅遊的訓練家都需要一個能夠暫時休息的庇護所。\n大多數城鎮都設有寶可夢中心：一個由寶可夢聯盟贊助的場所，讓所有註冊的訓練師和他們的寶可夢都能在這裡過夜，並在需要時接受醫療照顧。\n而最棒的是，這些完全免費！\n訓練家們可能會帶著受傷或疲累的寶可夢隊伍，在其中一間臥房中駐留一晚，並在隔日早晨立刻帶著恢復精神、煥然一新的夥伴們離開。\n多虧了寶可夢中心的治療裝置，鮮少會有需要動用手術治療的情況發生。儘管受到嚴重創傷的寶可夢或許仍需要花費較多的時間回復，但大多數的時候，寶可夢中心的專業團隊能夠在幾個小時之內讓六隻寶可夢的完整隊伍回復健康。\n在設施內通常會配有一名護士和一名治癒士寶可夢，像是吉利蛋、胖可丁、或是差不多娃娃。設施內還有著治療裝置，以及一間為防萬一而準備的急診室。\n在寶可夢中心的二樓有著供寶可夢訓練家們互動的交誼廳、以及讓他們過夜的寢室。這裡同時也提供了正規的寶可夢交換機器給需要的訓練家們使用。\n所有寶可夢中心都會直接向該地區的寶可夢聯盟回報。任何濫用或破壞聯盟規則的訓練家都會被寶可夢中心的職員給處分，他們的執照將會被吊銷或撤除。\n寶可夢中心是一個休息以及和其他訓練家交流的好地方，\n但在設施內戰鬥是被禁止的。\r 當你和你的夥伴感到疲累、需要醫療照顧、或者是單純需要一些關於你所在城鎮的資訊時，寶可夢中心是一個非常值得前去的場所。\n⬛ 寶可夢道館 所有的訓練家都想變得更強、提升自己隊伍的實力、設計出更傑出的戰術。然而，你自己能學到的東西終究有限，那麼如果有這麼一個地方，能讓你跟其他的訓練家互動、對戰、分享訣竅、甚至接受專業訓練家的個人指導呢？\n這正是寶可夢道館的目的。\n在這裡，你可以進行寶可夢對戰來證明自己的強大，或是單純旁觀其他訓練家的戰鬥並從中學習。每個道館都各自專攻不同的寶可夢屬性，且通常有著與之關聯的獨特主題裝潢。\n道館由被稱為「道館館主」的專業訓練家來營運。他或她可能會是在寶可夢聯盟中有著良好紀錄的訓練家。\n具體來說會是什麼？這個嘛，也許他們在水生寶可夢的協助下進行關於海洋的研究、也許他們為了弱小和被遺棄的寶可夢們成立了慈善機構、也可能單純只是他們的對戰實力強勁或經驗豐富。\n無論如何，各地區的聯盟認可這些人們的實力，並且授予了他們寶可夢道館館主的頭銜。\n任何訓練家都能夠前往道館並尋求諮詢、參加他們開設的課程、或是直接向道館館主發起挑戰。\n接受寶可夢對戰的挑戰是他們作為道館館主的責任，但你必須做好經歷一場激鬥的心理準備，因為他們非常強大。如果你贏了，那麼你將會得到道館徽章來證明自己的勝利。\n在設有寶可夢聯盟的地區內，都至少會有八個寶可夢道館。\n想要挑戰寶可夢聯盟舉辦的年度錦標賽的訓練家，必須收集至少八個道館徽章才能得到參加錦標賽的權利。\n⬛ 四天王 顧名思義，四天王是一個四人的團隊，其成員都是在該地區中被證實為強中之強的訓練家；「天王」這個頭銜是寶可夢訓練家所能擁有的最高級榮譽之一。\n要得到這個稱號，你在此之前必須多次獲得聯盟的認可。通常道館館主和其他強大的訓練家會被邀請參加一個特別的錦標賽事，來決定這個賽季的四天王成員。\n在這場特別的錦標賽中，四天王衛冕者們將必須在這些充滿抱負的菁英訓練家及道館館主的競爭中捍衛自己的頭銜。\n雖然四天王的身分顯赫，但他們並不會參與到公共事務之中。他們會出席一些聯盟舉辦的活動，但他們的私生活通常籠罩在秘密與謠言之中。\n唯一可以肯定的是，他們身為訓練家的實力是無庸置疑的。他們寶可夢所展現的純粹力量，毫無疑問只有真正的寶可夢大師才能做到。\n⬛ 冠軍 被稱為「冠軍」，就代表著處於金字塔的頂端。寶可夢聯盟中沒有其他更高的級別，且這個頭銜在訓練家及非訓練家之間都相當受到尊敬。\n每個地區都只會有一名冠軍，他們經常作為寶可夢聯盟的代表出現在大眾面前，並贏得所有人的驚嘆。\n冠軍比寶可夢大師還要高一級，在該地區之中沒有任何寶可夢比他培育的還要更快或更強。\n儘管許多人都夢想著加冕成為冠軍，但要取得聯盟冠軍的殊榮，唯有通過聯盟的艱難挑戰：首先，你必須接連擊敗所有四天王的成員──這是你取得挑戰冠軍資格的唯一途徑；接著，你得在一場竭盡全力的戰鬥中擊敗現任的冠軍，才能取得冠軍頭銜。\n這幾乎是一項不可能達成的壯舉。\n反派 寶可夢世界中同樣存在著犯罪與邪惡，而你最好有心理準備去面對它們。儘管大部分人們都過著和平的生活，但仍有人會想要利用他們的寶可夢去霸凌、破壞、偷竊、或甚至做些更加邪惡的行為。\n雖然警方能夠將大部分的違法者繩之以法，但仍有些犯罪組織因為勢力太過龐大而無法輕易被拿下。\n⬛ 火箭隊 這個案件最初是從一群從弱小訓練家身邊偷走他們寶可夢的混混們起頭。隨後，這些嫌疑犯又關聯到了另一起寶可夢道館徽章盜竊事件，最後甚至與西爾佛公司最高技術機密的搶劫案糾扯不清。而所有警方追查尋回的東西上，全都被標記了一個大大的紅色「R」記號。警方這才終於理解，他們面對的不只是一小搓犯罪份子，而是一個早已準備好引發各種麻煩的龐大組織。\n不久之後，許多與「火箭隊」有關的犯罪事件漸漸浮出水面，其中又以寶可夢搶劫以及私人財產的破壞行為居多。\n無論警方逮捕了多少火箭隊的成員，似乎總還是有更多的成員在暗中蠢蠢欲動，甚至有人懷疑火箭隊很有可能已經滲透進了關都的寶可夢聯盟之中。\n沒有人知道火箭隊的首領到底是誰，因為大多數被捕的成員都只是年輕世代的青年，他們加入的原因通常只是因為朋友也在裡面，加上金錢與權力的誘惑太過誘人的緣故。\n據了解，他們的目標是建立起一個跨越國界的強大犯罪王國。而這個目標，根據一些關於火箭隊員已經滲入城都地區的報告來看，似乎已經漸漸成為現實。\n當你造訪關都和城都地區時，請務必小心，否則你可能會被這高速火箭給狠狠炸飛。\n⬛ 海洋隊＆熔岩隊 豐緣地區的島嶼群中流傳著這麼一個傳說：為了掌控陸地和海洋的支配權，兩頭強大的巨獸之間展開了一場驚天動地的戰鬥。諷刺的是，直至今日，仍有兩幫惡棍相互爭奪著陸與海的領域，並為這個地區帶來了許多麻煩，他們就是「海洋隊」與「熔岩隊」。\n他們最終的目標至今仍不明朗，但可以確定的是，海洋隊的首領水梧桐和熔岩隊的首領赤焰松之間有著巨大的嫌隙，只要有機會，他們就會指使下屬們去阻撓挫敗對方的計畫。\n他們不會找市民或訓練家的麻煩，但他們兩隊的駁火交鋒偶爾仍會波及到一旁無辜的旁觀者。他們都曾經嘗試過偷走潛水艇裝備，但他們的企圖都受到了警察們的努力阻撓。\n⬛ 等離子隊 你可以在合眾地區的公園或其他公共場所看到他們，舉著擴音器與憤怒的標語，宣傳著寶可夢聯盟的恐怖、我們是如何讓寶可夢們成為我們的奴隸，以及我們為何應該還牠們自由。\n這些行為從任何角度來看都沒有違法。但在這個號稱捍衛寶可夢權利與福祉的團隊中還是有幾顆爛蘋果存在。曾有報導指出，「等離子隊」的團員強行奪走訓練家及市民的寶可夢以「解放」牠們。這毫無疑問是寶可夢盜竊罪的一種，也是這個世界中相當嚴重的一種犯罪行為；然而目前警方還沒有足夠的去起訴這些混蛋，因為那些被「偷走」的寶可夢們再也沒有被任何人發現。\n透過他們狂熱的標語，等離子團每一天都有更多的追隨者。距離下次他們綁架偷竊更多的寶可夢，又還要多久呢？\n⬛ 閃焰隊 在密阿雷市的豪華街道以及卡洛斯地區的其他地方，你可以看見這群打扮時尚的奇怪團體在四處遊蕩，他們自稱為「閃焰隊」。\n他們之中的少數人曾因為其可疑的行為而被拘留和訊問，但他們總是說他們的目標只是「創造一個更美好的世界」，並因此被釋放。\n他們打扮得體，說話動聽，甚至連身上的香味也很好聞。\n然而，在洞窟或遠離城市的荒郊裡看到這些優雅的人們仍會讓人有些不安。或許，他們公事包裡頭的東西能揭露出他們組織裏頭骯髒的秘密也說不定。\n現在，這些紅色制服怪咖的行蹤透露出了一種暴風雨前的平靜。但誰知道呢？也許一點星星之火就能引燃閃焰。\n⬛ 銀河隊 沒有人真的知道銀河隊從何而來。當警方意識到他們面對的是一群有組織的犯罪份子時，這個團體早已失去控制。\n「銀河隊」是他們的正式名稱。\n以偷竊高科技武器、太空計劃的研究成果和材料、危險設備、甚至秘密聯邦資產而聞名，他們的目的至今仍然是個謎。\n跟其他的犯罪組織不同，他們並沒有任何已知的招募流程，而且那些被捕的隊員身分也從未曝光。他們長時間潛伏在陰影中，並在奇襲之後又迅速消失無蹤。\n儘管最近的情報指出他們主要活躍於神奧地區，但他們實際上一直都是讓世界各地當局頭痛不已的組織。\n特派調查員已經前往該地區，但在那裏仍可能潛伏著一整個宇宙級的大麻煩。\n⬛ 骷髏隊 被警方認為是所有地區之中最無害的犯罪組織，「骷髏隊」也確實不負眾望！\n他們會插隊！偷走小朋友身上的糖果！在別人打噴嚏時永遠不會說「保重」！\n儘管他們以企圖偷走他人的寶可夢聞名，但所有他們的「受害者」最後都自己回到了主人身邊，而且完全沒有受到任何傷害。\n對於這些在該地區的成年禮中失敗後就引發各種小家子氣麻煩的叛逆孩子，阿羅拉的長者們相當不以為然。\n一位名叫古茲馬的傢伙領導著這群烏合之眾，他們沒有其他的目標，只是為了自娛其樂而惡作劇。\n目前還不清楚他們是如何獲取他們組織的財源，畢竟他們所使用的裝備並不是父母給的零用錢能夠支付的，肯定有什麼人在幕後資助他們。\n希望這些誤入歧途的孩子們能回到學校裡，不要再犯傻了。\n⬛ 吶喊隊 當你造訪伽勒爾地區時，你將會清楚感受到寶可夢對戰在那裡是多麼重要的盛事。\n賽場上總是有著盛大華麗的表演，大批粉絲聚集在一起，呼喊支持著他們最愛的訓練家。但老兄，這裡也存在著狂粉，而吶喊正是他們最擅長的舉動。有些人稱呼他們為「吶喊隊」，他們是一群小流氓組成的毒瘤粉絲，他們會做出任何事情來讓他們支持的訓練家取得優勢。\n封鎖進入會場的通道、操縱競技場、在戰鬥中大聲喊叫分散寶可夢的注意力、綁架裁判、當輸掉比賽時在整個城市鬧事，比賽勝利時則歡騰暴動。\n社群媒體上著名的訓練師「 MaArN1E r0XXy」得到了這個團隊的青睞，並讓他們成為了她的粉絲。他們心中並沒有甚麼統治世界的大計畫，他們只不過想保護自己女王（難得）的微笑。\n最好離他們遠點，不過別擔心，你在幾英哩外就能聽到他們的吶喊。\n由於寶可夢是擔任自我防衛及警方辦案工作的首選，武器在這個世界中相當罕見。儘管它們確實存在且仍然會被使用，但在本規則中並沒有任何列表記錄它們的數據和功能。\n如果你決定在你的故事中使用它們，請將它們視為一種「劇情工具」。\r 本書中並沒有任何關於「劇情工具」的規則。你將必須自行斟酌該如何讓它們在你的故事設定中發揮。\r ⬛ 勁敵 有時候，某人會生活在他人的陰影下，有些人似乎總是更有才華、更受歡迎、更成功。\n不幸的是，這可能就是你會遇到的情況！你的勁敵正是你人生和夢想前方的敵人！這是一場個人的挑戰，證明誰才是更優秀的那個！\n在寶可夢對戰這個競爭激烈的世界中，由於許多人都有著相同的目標，因此擁有一名勁敵關係的對手相對較為普遍。\n勁敵的形式各種各樣，從童年朋友到昔日的死對頭，他可能是好人、是壞人、是熟知的、是神祕的。但是無論他們是什麼樣的人，他們永遠都會是您成為寶可夢大師的夢想的障礙。\n他可以懷抱著任何動機，只要那能讓你的訓練家生活變成一場噩夢即可──不要以為他們會在你的寶可夢旅程中雙手抱胸什麼都不做。\n他的人生將與你的冒險緊緊相關，其程度甚至超乎你的想像。但也多虧了他的存在，你將能夠變得更加堅強茁壯。\n成為一名訓練家 現在你更了解寶可夢的世界了。這世界充滿著美好和危險。但是，這與你又有什麼關係呢？\n在這個遊戲中，你將扮演寶可夢訓練家的角色。\n在這個世界，訓練家是鼓舞激勵他人的源泉，他們是領導力，勇氣，友善和其他許多美德的體現。\n你將生活在這個寶可夢世界中，面對這個世界可能帶給你的考驗。克服困難，解決危機。考驗你和你寶可夢的能力，並努力讓每一天變得更好。\n寶可夢訓練家渴望成為最好的。他們正在進行一場讓自己更加強壯、更加聰慧、更全面性成長的旅途。而他們實現這個目標的方式，將取決於他們在寶可夢世界中所經歷的冒險。挑戰其他訓練家、參加寶可夢競賽、騎乘在他們最為信賴的寶可夢背上；同時，他們也會野外求生，並將這些時光跟他們的朋友一起分享。\n一個全新的冒險世界正在等待你，期許著你盡你所能的做到最好。\n","description":"介紹這個令人驚奇的寶可夢世界。各個地區、各個組織。","id":8,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"神奇的寶可夢世界","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/the-world/"},{"content":"Contest

The Kahuna chiefs and their Pokémon wore special jewels with crystals that shone with energy ready to be unleashed to defend their people.\nThese Jewels are now known as Z-Crystals, if you and your Pokémon hold them and perform the ritual dances, you’ll be able to use what is known as a Z-Move to give a taste of the power of friendship to those who oppose you.\nRules for Z-Moves  To use a Z-Move both Trainer and Pokémon must be holding a Z-Crystal and perform the ritual dance. Z-Moves can only be used once per day. Using them more will cost 5 Will points for the Trainer and the Pokémon. A Pokémon may only use a Z-Move taking as Base a Move of the same Type already on its Move pool. Z- Moves are Physical, Special or Support depending on what the Base Move is. Damaging Z-Moves add points to the Power of the Base Move equal to the total score of Happiness and Loyalty on the Pokémon. Added Effects of the Base Move are replaced by those on the Z-Move. Added Effects and Targets of Z-Moves are fully customizable at Storyteller’s Discretion. Z-Moves cannot be used to Clash.

You’ll be at the mercy of your surroundings.\nAnyone who faints will stay out for an average of 8 hours. After that time, their body will automatically heal itself 1 Damage and the character may regain consciousness.\nThe item Revive allows you to recover from fainting in a few seconds. A regular healing Potion will cure damage made to the body and may prevent the wounds from getting more serious, but the character will remain unconscious.\nFainting is a bad experience for a Pokémon. If you regularly order them to keep fighting until they collapse this will eventually strain your relationship with them by reducing their happiness and loyalty.\nIt is not too wise to risk your Trainer character to faint in a battle. If a Pokémon faints, it can be recalled into its Pokéball and stay secure until it can get treatment; but a fainted trainer will need the aid of other humans to get back on his feet as Pokémon companions cannot apply medicine.\nWild Pokémon will usually cease to attack if the trainer faints and is no longer a menace. But staying out cold completely helpless may put at risk your character’s life.\nLethal Damage (Optional) If you or a Pokémon fall unconscious and keep receiving damage, that damage will become Lethal Damage.\nSome Pokémon can learn devastating moves able to inflict Lethal Damage directly.\nUnlike regular damage, that heals itself over time, receiving Lethal damage involves getting a serious injury that will worsen if left unattended.\nIf the characters suffer 1 lethal damage, they will suffer another lethal damage every hour until they get medical attention or their body cannot hold any longer and the character dies.\nLethal Damage Moves are banned from official League matches, but your Pokémon may still use them if it holds back the full force of the attacks to deal regular damage.\nA move labeled with this Icon Will deal Lethal Damage unless the Pokémon holds back:\n{@icon lethal|l}\nStaying Safe If you suffer Lethal Damage equal to your total HP your character will die. To prevent this, take measures to keep you and your Pokémon safe.\n  Spare no expense in Healing items.\nPotions can be expensive but the life of your Pokémon companions has no price.\n  Teach your Pokémon healing moves. If a Pokémon is able to learn a move that allows it to recover a little health maybe you should give it priority over learning a damaging move.\n  Learn the Medicine Skill.\nThere will be times when the potions run out.\nHaving a Trainer in the party who knows how to find and make medicine out of herbs and berries is a life saver!\n  Evade attacks and find cover. Pokémon battles have flames and energy beams flying everywhere, find a safe place where your trainer can stay out of harm.\n   If a Pokémon or Trainer is going to die, make it meaningful, no sacrifice is ever in vain.\nNo character is disposable.\r Pain Penalizations When your body is injured you will feel pain. As you or your Pokémon receive damage, your movements and overall performance will be impaired due to the wounds. This is what we call Pain Penalization.\nRemove Successes from every Action you attempt,\ndepending on how badly your Character is injured. To measure the amount of pain you’re in, you must take into account your total HP and follow this simple chart:\n\r\rHP State\rPain Penalization\rBody State\r\r\rFull HP\rNone\rNo pain or discomfort.\r\r\rHalf HP (Rounded down)\r1 Removed Success\rPain is now hindering you, moving is difficult.\r\r\r1 HP remaining\r2 Removed Successes\rYou are about to black out. Everything seems blurry and standing is painful.\r\r\rPain Penalizations will be applied to all the actions you make while injured. Rolls for: Accuracy. Damage, All Social Attributes, Strength, Dexterity, Special, and Insight are also affected; however, rolls using Vitality and Will are not.\nPain penalizations will be removed as soon as you heal. If you cannot heal HP, you can also spend 1 Will Point to ignore 1 Removed Success from penalizations for the rest of the scene.\nPain penalization may be assigned without receiving damage.\nFor example when the characters are exhausted by exercise, lack of food or sleep.\r ","description":"","id":11,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"傷害","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/pokemon-battle/damage/"},{"content":"Multiple Actions (Optional) This is where you get fast and furious. You can abuse your speed and intellect to divide your attention and perform multiple tasks at the same time.\nMost common use is in battle; you can attack, evade and support your allies, but Multiple Actions are not limited to fights.\nMaybe you want to read a book while driving a car, or maybe you want to catch a ball and kick your foe while dodging bullet seeds. I’m not saying that everything is possible, but you can at least try! Worst case scenario: You die.\nAll you have to do is:\nRoll the dice pool for your action. However, every Action beyond the first, will require 1 additional Success.\nMultiple ActionRequired Successes\r1st Action 1 \r2nd Action 2 \r3rd Action 3 \r4th Action 4 \r5th Action 5 \r\rPain Penalizations, Low Accuracy, and other penalties may substract Successes from your Rolls.\nYou may perform up to 5 multiple actions each round, and it gets harder and harder the more you push your skills, if you are not skilled enough you risk suffering a Critical Failure.\nWhen a Pokémon is acting on its own, they usually won’t make more than one or two actions, even if they are capable of doing more.\r You can take your 2nd action only after everybody else had a chance to act, the only exceptions being: Successive Actions and Evasion/Clash.\nIf you make lots of actions it means that you are moving really quick.

Learn them all and any Pokémon at your side will be champion material.\n⬛ Holding Action When you declare to hold your action your character will remain immobile looking at the foe, this will seem like an invitation to the foe or someone else to act before you do.\nYou may use the action you were holding at any point during the round.\nIf both you and your foe hold action the round will end with no further actions.\nIt means that both sides paused the fight to eye each other warily\u0026hellip;\n⬛ Evading It is always a smart move to get away from danger. You may do this by evading attacks or finding cover.\nOnce per Round you can Evade an attack, simply have to give the order “Evade it!” or “Dodge!”. Your Pokémon will understand that danger is coming its way and will react as fast as possible.\nAn Evasion action can be triggered regardless of initiative order at the cost of an action. All you need to do is Roll:\nDexterity + Evasion\rIf you score as many Succesess as your foe, you evade the attack.\nEvading counts as an Action, thus, acting again this Round will require another Success as stated on the table for Multiple Actions.\nEvasion can be performed only once per Round.\n\n⬛ Clashing Attacks Some Pokémon are not dexterous enough to be constantly evading, but they can rely on their sheer power to fend off their foe’s attacks by doing what we call a Clash.\nOnce per Round, when an opponent makes its Accuracy Roll you can order your Pokémon to use one of its own Damaging Moves (i.e. Thunderbolt, Water Gun, Close Combat) to try to deflect most of the damage . Simply Roll:\nStrength/Special + Clash\rIf you score as many Succesess as your foe, you clash the attack and both your foe and your Pokémon will suffer 1 damage instead of the foe making a damage roll.\nClashing counts as an Action, thus, acting again this Round will require another Success as stated on the table for Multiple Actions.\nAll Damage taken from a Clash is affected by the Super Effective and It’s Not Very Effective rule.\nWhile not as effective as Evasion to reduce damage intake, Clashing attacks is a good option for slower but strong and resilient Pokémon.\nClash can be performed only once per Round.\n\nOnce you use a Move for a Clash you can’t repeat it during the same Round; You’ll have to wait until the next one!\r Support Moves, Moves that ignore Defenses and Moves that have a Set Damage can’t be Clashed.\r ⬛ Taking Cover This action will help you resist damage against Ranged attacks depending on much of your body is covered.\nBody Coverage Bonus Def/SDef vs Ranged Attacks \r1/4 +1 \r1/2 +2 \rFull Cover must be destroyed \r\rIt is possible to avoid damage completely at Storyteller’s Discretion. A Cover may be destroyed after taking a few hits.\nYou can use the Maneuver “Cover an Ally” to use your body as a shield for a small Pokémon.\nOr you can make a big Pokémon use it to cover yourself!\r ⬛ Same Type Attack Bonus (STAB) All Pokémon can control different Types of energy, but these energies will come out naturally stronger if they are from thier own Type.\nFor example, a Grass-Type is stronger at controlling plants, while a Normal-type won\u0026rsquo;t be as powerful when trying to do the same.\nUsing Moves that match their own type will give you an edge when trying to deal damage.\nWhenever a Pokémon performs an Attack that matches one of its types you’ll get the “Same Type Attack Bonus” or STAB for short.\nThis adds 1 Bonus Dice to the Damage Pools of matching Type attacks.\n ⬛ Low Accuracy Moves If you perform a move labeled with a sign like this:\n{@icon frame|accuracy|命中|down|1}{@icon frame|accuracy|命中|down|2}{@icon frame|accuracy|命中|down|3}\nRemove the noted number of Successes from your Accuracy Roll.\nTake a look at this example:\nPikachu is trying to attack its foe Stunky with the move Thunder. Which has an Accuracy of -2: {@icon dice|l|5}Pikachu’s Dice Pool, with {@icon frame|accuracy|命中|down|2} Move Accuracy\nRoll Results: {@icon rdice|s|1}{@icon rdice|s|6|fail}{@icon rdice|s|3}{@icon rdice|s|4|fail}{@icon rdice|s|3} (-2 Successes)\nThe roll fails. A Thunder stroke in the arena but it did not hit the target.\nOn Stunky’s turn he uses the move Smokescreen reducing Pikachu’s Accuracy by 1.\nIn the next Round, Pikachu’s Accuracy Roll for Thunder would be:\n{@icon dice|l|5}Pikachu’s Dice Pool, with {@icon frame|accuracy|命中|down|3} Move Accuracy\nRoll Results: {@icon rdice|s|1}{@icon rdice|s|6|fail}{@icon rdice|s|6|fail}{@icon rdice|s|4|fail}{@icon rdice|s|2} (-3 Successes)\nPikachu would have to train its skills to get better at controlling this kind of attacks.\n Pain Penalizations and other penalties may remove even more successes from your Roll.\nThe power of some Moves might seem tempting, but you’ll need a lot more than powerful moves to win your battles.\nIf your foe is relying on powerful but unaccurate Moves, don’t be scared, make their advantage become their disadvantage by Evading or Clashing.\n⬛ Attributes: Increase \u0026amp; Reduction You will notice that some moves are marked with this kind of icons:\n{@icon frame|self|特質|up|1}{@icon frame|self|特質|down|1} {@icon frame|target|特質|up|1}{@icon frame|target|特質|down|1}\nMost of them don’t deal damage but increase or reduce the attributes of a Pokémon instead.\nIt is a valid strategy to reduce your foe’s Attributes to get an advantage. If you combine this with increasing your own Pokémon Attributes, you will be on the right path to victory.\nA Move may increase or decrease an attribute by 1, 2 or 3 points, this effect is only temporary.\nThese points do not stack on the same attribute, but instead only take into account the move with the highest modifier.\nA Shellder with a Defense of 5 used the move Withdraw as its first action.\nIts Defense will be increased 1 point making it a total of 6.\nOn its next action, Shellder used the move Iron Defense, which increases its Defense by 2 points. Its Defense will now be 7. The effects of Withdraw are replaced.\nIf Shellder uses Iron Defense once again the next round, its Defense would remain unchanged.\n The same rule applies for decreasing the attributes of a Pokémon, with the only exception that once an attribute is decreased to just 1 point, it cannot be decreased further.\nSome Held Items will directly affect the attributes of a Pokémon but their effects will not stack along with the effects of a move and you will take into account only the highest modifier.\nTemporary increases of attributes can only make a Pokémon reach a maximum of 10 Points.\nThat means that if your Pokémon already has a score of 10 in an attribute it won’t be able to increase it further.\nIf your Pokémon has reached the limit score on its attribute, and increases it using a move or ability, as long as it keeps it on 10 or less it will be able to do so without problems.\nWhen combined with Abilities, Pokémon can achieve incredible power through temporary increases in Power, Defense and Speed.\nTake these examples of combining moves and abilities to increase your own attributes or reduce your foe’s:\nYour Floatzel has 4 points of Dexterity. Its Ability is Swift Swim, which increases Dexterity by 2 Points during Rain weather.\nIt is raining at the moment and Floatzel uses the Move Agility in its turn. This move adds 2 Points to the user’s Dexterity.\nFloatzel ends up with 8 total Dexterity Points: 4 points are its own, 2 from its Ability and 2 more from the Move it used.\nYour little pink Snubull goes into battle, against an aggressive Tyranitar with a Strength score of 4. Fortunately, Snubull has the ability Intimidate, which reduces by 1 point the Strength of all foes in range.\nOn its turn, Snubull uses the move Charm, which means a further reduction of 2 points for the foe. By the end of Snubull’s turn, Tyranitar only has 1 point on its Strength Attribute.\nNow that doesn’t sound too menacing!\n\nIt is illegal to go into an official match of the league with your Pokémon already buffed. You’ll have to put it back into its Pokéball and let it out when the match begins.\r All these Power-ups and downs are only temporary.\nThey will last for a scene or until the Pokémon is removed from battle.\n⬛ Critical Hit To land a Critical Hit you have to score 3 more successes than what is required for your Accuracy Roll.\nIf you do, you will add 2 dice to your Damage Pool.\nArchen is fighting Amaura. Archen managed to land a Critical-Hit with the move Crunch.\nThis will be Archen’s Damage Pool:\n{@icon dice|m|4} Archen’s Strength\n+ {@icon dice|m|3} Crunch’s Power\n+ {@icon dice|m|2} Critical Hit Bonus\n- {@icon dice|m|2} Amaura’s Defense\nAmaura is at risk of receiving a serious amount of damage from Archen’s Attack!\n Also, Moves labeled with this Icon:\n{@icon crit|l}\nAre called “High-Critical” moves.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll need only 2 more Successes than necessary, to get a Critical hit!\n⬛ Holding Back Sometimes it will be more convenient to contain the full force of your Pokémon’s attacks.\nPerhaps a move is extremely powerful but it may hurt your allies as well, maybe you are fighting a wild Pokémon you want to catch and do not want it to faint. Or it could be that you are participating in an official League Tournament and you cannot use your favorite move by going all out.\nFor those cases, you give the command to “Hold Back” in order to do either of the next options:\n  Deal Half Damage.\nYou make your damage roll normally but only inflict half of the damage rounded down to those affected by your attack.\n  Deal Regular Damage instead of Lethal Damage.\nIf your order your Pokémon to use a move that would deal Lethal Damage: {@icon lethal|l}\n  You can also add the order: “Restrain yourself!”, “Don’t use full force!” or something along the lines so the damage your Pokémon inflicts will not need a trip to the emergency room \u0026hellip;or the graveyard.\n⬛ Priority and Low Priority Many actions and Moves are quick and abrupt or slow and complex. Priority and Low Priority are terms to indicate which Moves get into effect outside of the normal Initiative order. They are labeled by these signs:\n{@icon frame|priority|優先度|up|1}{@icon frame|priority|優先度|down|1}\nThey represent Priority, which allows a Pokémon to act right away even if it’s not their turn yet.\nAnd Low Priority, in which the Pokémon will use its move but it will take effect at the End of the Round.\nIn case two Pokémon are using a Priority move at the same time, the move with higher Priority number will be resolved first. In case both have the same priority number, the initiative order will determine who resolves it first. Take into account: once you announce a Priority Move, your foe may change his order/action to an Evasion, or it may use another Priority Move.\nLow Priority is the opposite, it will take effect at the End of the Round, it may look like the foe is holding their action while in reality, it is just about to strike.\n⬛ Healing In-Battle There are three ways to heal a character in-battle:\n By applying healing items, such as Spray Potions or medicine on them. One Potion unit heals 1 damage, two units heal 1 lethal damage. By using a held item such as a Berry. By using moves that restore your health. These moves may require the user to spend 1 Will Point to get the benefits.  Humans cannot use healing moves but can have Pokémon use some of their moves on them, they also can’t have a held item but they are free to use a berry or medicine and apply it on themselves or their Pokémon.\nNow, while the healing in this world can be miraculously fast, a 10-second Round is too-short a time to make a full recovery from some wounds.\nWhen you are in battle, potions, berries and Moves can only heal a maximum of 3 HP per round.\nComplete Heal, Max Potion, and Full Restore are the only things able to heal more.\n Some Pokémon are able to learn moves that restore health. They are identified with this icons:\n{@icon heal|l}\rBasic Heal \rHeal regular damage equal to 3 HP.\r\r\r{@icon c_heal|l}\rComplete Heal \rHeal regular and Lethal damage equal to 5 HP.\r\r\r{@icon frame|heal|治療|heal|2}\rFixed Heal \rFor example: Heal up to 2 Damage.\r\r\r{@icon frame|heal|治療|c_heal|2}\rFixed Complete Heal \rFor example: Heal up to 2 Lethal Damage.\r\r\rIf your Pokémon makes the Accuracy roll to activate a move labeled with any of these icons and succeeds, you need to spend 1 Will Point in order to get their benefits. If the Accuracy roll fails you don’t need to spend the Will Point.\nHealing Moves are not infinite, Your Pokemon’s Will score can run out before recovering all of its HP.\nAlways carry Potions!\r You can only heal 3 HP per round when using Potions and most healing moves, but moves identified with this icon.\n{@icon c_heal|l}\rComplete Heal \rAre able to heal up to 5 HP per round.\r\r\rOnce you reach the healing limit or the Subject restores its full HP, the recovery stops and any remaining points will be lost.\nTake this example:\nYour Meganium is fighting a wild Pokémon and you order it to use the move Grassy Terrain.\nOne of the effects of Grassy Terrain is this:\n{@icon frame|heal|治療|heal|1}\nFor the next 4 Rounds, User and Allies on the ground Restore 1 HP at the End of the Round.\nThe battle continues and Meganium receives a brutal strike, it has 2 HP remaining from its total HP of 9. It needs healing ASAP. You run to its aid with a Potion in hand and apply 3 units of Potion that will restore 3 HP to Meganium. However, the HP healed from Grassy Terrain won’t take effect this round and won’t carry on to the next one.\nA couple of rounds pass and someone activated Sunny Weather in the field, Meganium has 5 HP so you order it to use the move Synthesis, one of its effects being:\n{@icon c_heal|l}\nIf Sunny Weather is in effect this Move becomes a Complete Heal.\nThis means it would recover 5 HP, but Meganium’s only has taken 4 damage, So it heals 4 HP and the remaining point is lost.\n ⬛ Shield Moves There are some moves labeled with this icon:\n{@icon shield|l}\nTheir effects may differ from one another but they all have one thing in common, they are actions that involve using a shield against an incoming attack.\nUnlike evading, Pokémon using these moves receive the attacks head-on with certainty that they’ll come out practically unscathed. Shield Moves can reduce damage to zero.\nThere’s a catch, though. You can only use one shield move per round, and if you use one the next round as well you\u0026rsquo;ll get an Extra -2 Reduced Accuracy to their accuracy roll, increasing the chances of failure for every shield move you use each round. If you do not use a shield move for a whole round this effect resets.\nFor every Shield Move you use round after round, you’ll be adding an extra reduced Accuracy.\nThat means:\nShield Move on Round 1\n{@icon shield|l}\nShield Move on Round 2\n{@icon shield|l} + {@icon frame|accuracy|命中|down|2}\nShield Move on Round 3\n{@icon shield|l} + {@icon frame|accuracy|命中|down|4}\nAnd so on if you keep using them uninterruptedly.\n ⬛ Successive Actions Multiple Actions are handled per round. But some moves have the special property of unleashing all actions at once, these are called “Succesive Actions”\nMoves marked with this symbols:\n{@icon d_act|l} {@icon s_act|l}\nMean that you can unleash from 2 to 5 multiple actions in a single attack!\nMeowth will use the move Fury Swipes, which is a Successive Action move.\nFor it’s Accuracy roll, Meowth will roll following the Multiple Actions rule for successes, only this time the actions called will be released all at once. Trainer calls for 2 multiple actions to be used on Fury Swipes:\nMeowth’s first Swipe:\n{@icon dice|l|5}Meowth’s Dice Pool, with {@icon frame|accuracy|命中|down|1} Move Accuracy\nRoll Results: {@icon rdice|s|2}{@icon rdice|s|3}{@icon rdice|s|4|fail}{@icon rdice|s|5}{@icon rdice|s|1} (1 Required Successes)\nMeowth’s second Swipe:\n{@icon dice|l|5}Meowth’s Dice Pool, with {@icon frame|accuracy|命中|down|1} Move Accuracy\nRoll Results: {@icon rdice|s|3}{@icon rdice|s|1}{@icon rdice|s|4}{@icon rdice|s|5}{@icon rdice|s|5|fail} (2 Required Successes)\nAll of this means that Meowth performed two attacks in a single turn, and if its Dice pool grows with some training, Meowth will be capable of making up to 5 attacks in a single Turn!\n ","description":"","id":15,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"勝利策略","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/pokemon-battle/strategies-to-win/"},{"content":"Coordinator Ranks We mentioned before that Rank is a representation of time and effort put into a particular lifestyle, There are Ranks for activities besides Pokémon Training, these Ranks will add benefits to your Character.\nIf you dedicate yourself to winning Contests you will be able to gain Coordinator Ranks, these do not replace your Pokémon Trainer Rank but add to it.\nThink about it as a specialization to being a Pokémon Trainer.\nCoordinators have their own types of skills that benefit them greatly in social situations.

Both humans and Pokémon have their values and what’s important to them defined by it. All people and Pokémon have their own unique personality, but it is their Nature what defines how they will react to certain situations.\nYour Nature will show what’s inside your mind and that will reflect on the exterior. Some Natures are beneficial for certain aspects of life and all of them can have their own hindrance when facing certain situations.\nPokémon can overcome the limitations of their Nature with the help of their trainer. A fearful or aggressive Pokémon can become friendly and social with the right treatment.\nPokémon might also change their Nature when they evolve.\nFor humans, though, the power to act against your own nature can only come from within yourself through your Will Attribute.\nKeep in mind that Humans are able to think or feel one way yet act another.\nPokémon on the other hand tend to act according to what they feel and will stay true to their Natures.\r The Nature you pick will also determine your Confidence.A trait that you\u0026rsquo;ll need when facing stressful situations.\nONCE DEFINED, A TRAINER\u0026rsquo;S NATURE CANNOT BE CHANGED.\nA Pokémon\u0026rsquo;s Nature might change when it evolves or thanks to its training at Storyteller\u0026rsquo;s discretion.\nTake your Nature into account when deciding the actions you’ll take in the game.\nDepending on how well you portray the traits of your Nature you can get rewarded in the game.\nWILL POINTS ARE AN AWARD FOR ROLE-PLAYING YOUR NATURE\nIf you need to recover Will Points, acting your Nature is a good way to start.

The fact that some Natures do not seem to get along with each other, it’s no reason for disrupting the fun of the game. On the contrary, they are a chance to complement the characters and create new interactions and fun dynamics.\nThe Nature of your Pokémon can also create different ways to interact, as not only they get to bond with their trainer but also with their other Pokémon teammates. Will they get along? Will they form rivalry or friendship?\nHave fun exploring how rich your game can be when you mix all different personalities into a pot. It is certainly one of the most entertaining parts of the game.\nConfidence People and Pokémon need to interact with each other, and while their Nature defines their core feelings, it will also affect how well they can handle negative stimuli towards their own ego.\nSome individuals relish in being the center of attention, others just love hanging out in big groups while there\u0026rsquo;ll be a bunch who prefer solitude, quiet places or simply want to be left alone.\nSocial Situations and Pokémon Contests might put you through a lot of Stress, this Stress might damage your Confidence, and the Emotional Damage you receive can create difficulties for you.\nIf your Trainer is interested on becoming a Coordinator, Confidence will be one of your most valuable traits.\nHead to the Pokémon Contest section of this book to learn all about Confidence and its uses. p. 63\nNature List Adamant\rPowerful, Fierce, Relentless\rConfidence: 4\rAn indomitable will that won’t falter. Those with Adamant nature are belligerent and impassive. Only the strong survive in this world, that’s why powerand strength are what they respect the most. You are either their equal or you’re inferior. Working as a team does not fit them well. They believe everyone must carry their own weight and those who can’t will be left behind.They also lash out when they feel threatened and rarely care for social norms.\n Bashful\rCompassionate, Vulnerable, Family Oriented\rConfidence: 6\rThere is an adorable shyness in them. They enjoy the simple things in life and are quite sensitive to other’s emotions. They are very conscious about their own weaknesses and will try to make them better, but it hurts them to be pushed around and they may feel intimidated or disheartened if the challenges are too big. They need a strong figure who believes in them to feel confident but the fact that they are aware of their own weakness is a great advantage though.\n Bold\rAdventurous, Confident, Daring\rConfidence: 9\rReal thrill seekers. The Bold view life with optimism and excitement, they firmly believe one must go forward no matter the consequences. They are easily provoked and quick to take action, often heading into challenges a lot bigger than themselves. Failure is something that hits them hard, but they are known for getting back on their feet again and charge for adventure one more time. There’s no mountain big enough to stop them and they love to be the center of attention.\n Brave\rFearless, Level-headed, Protector\rConfidence: 9\rThe Brave of heart will face any situation with courage and a cool head. They won’t tolerate bullying or abuse anywhere near them and will always encourage others to conquer their fears. “Selfless” is their second name, as they will never turn their back on their comrades even at the cost of their own safety. Others look up to them as they inspire confidence and trust. They strive to conquer their fears and wish to inspire others to do the same. They keep it together when stress begins to escalate.\n Calm\rReasonable, Peaceful, Balanced\rConfidence: 8\rPeace and tranquility is the most important thing for those with a Calm nature. They are not noisy nor they want many thrills in their lives. Conflict is not welcome and they tend to be peacemakers. It is rare to see them fall for provocations as they keep their distance and composure when facing trouble. They dislike stress and overbearing attention, but their presence is pleasant and soothing.\n Careful\rAnalytic, Skeptical, Withdrawn\rConfidence: 5\rThose with this nature will often ponder their options according to the level of risk. If the benefit is substantial but the risk is too great they will prefer an option less rewarding but also less risky. They may take some time to warm up to strangers and will always be alert to their surroundings. Keeping a situation under control is important for them, not being in control makes them anxious and stressed. If things get out of hand they might run away to fight another day.\n Docile\rKind, Team worker, Service spirit\rConfidence: 7\rAlways with a courteous disposition, a Docile nature indicates that you put others before yourself. Those under this nature love to please and be of assistance to their companions and community. They\u0026rsquo;re not big achievers and might lack initiative, but even if only one person appreciates their efforts they will feel accomplished.\nThey make great teammates and will be the first to ask: “How may I be of service?”\n Gentle\rGraceful, Charismatic, Extroverts\rConfidence: 10\rA Gentle personality reflects on graceful conversations and pleasant social interactions. They enjoy doing things with care and refinement, and others come to them simply to revel in their sophisticated presence. They enjoy luxuries but can be quite demanding with their tastes. These natural socialites were born to be in the spotlight and they don\u0026rsquo;t like to share it.\n Hardy\rDependable, Resilient, Resourceful\rConfidence: 9\rLife has been tough, but they know how to face anything no matter how difficult. The word “disheartened” is not for them, they have a great tolerance for stress and frustration so they rarely get worked up.\nYou’ll rarely find them unprepared. They do their best to endure and overcome. Taking things lightly is difficult for them, but they are dependable. They’ll help you get through the hardest of scenarios.\n Hasty\rEager, Enthusiastic, Hustle\rConfidence: 7\rEnergetic, spontaneous and a little impulsive.\nThey live in the moment and don’t have time to mop about past losses or worry about future battles. They are eager to see what comes next, moving from one thing to another. They rarely stress out because they make their lives on the go and rarely sit to relax or meditate things through. There will always be something to do with them around, let them improvise.\n Impish\rMischievous, Witty, Playful\rConfidence: 7\rFree spirits hungry for enjoyment and fun at the expense of others. They carry themselves with a light heart but you can also see a smug smirk on their faces. Playful, irreverent and agile of mind, they dislike routine and chores. They are the kind to circle around a problem as a head-on confrontation will stress them.\nThey also want a little validation from others so they\u0026rsquo;ll get attention as the pranksters of the group.\n Jolly\rCheerful, Charming, Energetic\rConfidence: 10\rThey love to spread happiness around and will always have a smile to give you. They rarely feel gloomy and dislike when others do. They easily form close friendships as others enjoy their good mood and affable disposition. They know the power to move a mountain lies in an enthusiastic demeanor and positive thoughts; regardless of the hard times their cheerful smile will brighten your day.\n Lax\rUnconcerned, Indolent, Simple\rConfidence: 8\rLax is an inconstant nature, those under it will do things whenever they feel like it. Is not that they are lazy, they just don’t see the need to waste energy on stuff that’s not important for them yet. Since they don’t care to fill anyone’s expectations they rarely stress out about social norms, but they\u0026rsquo;ll need a reason to keep motivated and an even better reason to be pro-active instead of indifferent.\n Lonely\rIndependent, Introspective, Solitary\rConfidence: 5\rThey like to keep their distance and do everything on their own. They often feel it’s up to them and nobody else to get things done and will take the burden of a responsibility that should be shared.\nInteracting with others is like a chore for them but being isolate also makes them feel misunderstood. They are hard to get close to but they can be trusted to do their best even if there\u0026rsquo;s no one to guide them.\n Mild\rMeek, Serene, Comforting\rConfidence: 8\r“Harmless” is the word that best describes a Mild nature. They are patient and calm with others, reliable and caring on every matter. Because of this, others seek their company as stability ground. They seek to understand others and have a natural talent to do it. They tend to keep their needs to themselves and sometimes stay in the background, but they are the ones to turn when you need someone to listen.\n Modest\rMeasured, Self-Assured, Hard Worker\rConfidence: 10\rWhen you are aware of your potential you don’t need others to praise you for it. A modest nature knows the reward is the constant improvement of their abilities, not the acknowledging of others. They won’t show off nor will they feel diminished when others display better capabilities. They’ll do their best always and the only one who may judge the right or wrong of their ways is themselves.\n Naive\rCurious, Lighthearted, Innocent\rConfidence: 7\rThe world is full of wonder; there is always something new to discover and many others to befriend. A Naive nature is a curious and innocent nature, they easily trust others because they ignore the many dan\u0002gers of the world. They still have a lot to learn but they take life as it comes. They rarely stress out due to the fact they still don\u0026rsquo;t know there are many things to stress about. A friend\u0026rsquo;s smile and a hand to take it\u0026rsquo;s all they need.\n Naughty\rDevious, Rebel, Sly\rConfidence: 6\rWhy should they listen to you? You are not their boss! Most of the time they’ll deliberately do the opposite from what’s expected from them. Why? Because they can, of course. They love to see others get mad and will use their clever mind and cunning to get away with their misdeeds. When they stress they put a cool facade, don\u0026rsquo;t let that fool you. They need to be coaxed or put in their place to behave properly.\n Quiet\rSilent, Reserved, Espectator\rConfidence: 5\rLife is what happens around those with a Quiet nature. They often take a passive stance over the circumstances around them. Strong thoughts or opinions they have will rarely be expressed, so they are not the greatest at social interactions. They may be afraid to make a mistake or consider it a hassle to take action. When they manage to get the attention of others they rarely know what to do with themselves.\n Quirky\rUnusual, Open-Minded, Original\rConfidence: 9\rYou can’t really understand how their mind works. Those who have a Quirky nature will usually see the world in a unique way that only they seem to comprehend. The way they act will be peculiar and often attract puzzled looks, they know they are oddballs and are fine with it, but they might get stressed by the strangest of things. The way they see the world is so unique that they accept new things easily.\n Rash\rReckless, Unrefined, Daredevil\rConfidence: 6\rThey are reckless, and exposing themselves to danger is their idea of fun. Blunt and direct in the way they act with others, you are either their friend or you are their enemy. They are known for rushing into action with a “hit first, ask later” mentality. They are also famous for their quick-temper, loud-mouth, and foolhardy deeds, so don\u0026rsquo;t expect them to keep their cool when stress starts to elevate.\n Relaxed\rCarefree, Meditative, Nonchalant\rConfidence: 8\rThe problems of the world are not their problems. A Relaxed nature will allow its bearer to take it easy and never lose their cool. They will never stress over trivial matters and won’t instigate trouble. Should disputes arise, they will invite others to calm down through breathing and meditation, they go with the flow, never against it. Some may call them carefree, they will call themselves enlightened.\n Sassy\rLively, Irreverent, Mouthy\rConfidence: 7\rThey have an attitude, and those who take themselves too seriously may dislike it, but the Sassy natured are simply not afraid to voice their honest opinion and will always find ways to speak their mind and it\u0026rsquo;s always brutally honest, so be ready for some burns.\nThere are no middle grounds with them, they either love or hate something so they can be infuriatingly difficult or surprisingly easy to deal with, that is part of their charm.\n Serious\rSteadfast, Rigid, Commited\rConfidence: 4\rThey have a big sense of responsibility and won’t appreciate when others don’t take things seriously. Stress is a constant in their lives, if they have a duty to fulfill they will not stop until it’s finished, everything else is a useless distraction once they have a task. They might need a hand since have a hard time relaxing but if you want things done well they are the ones to look for.\n Timid\rShy, Apprehensive, Sensible\rConfidence: 4\rThey have built walls around themselves that make it hard for others to see what’s inside. They just want to be accepted but tend to worry too much and be way too harsh on themselves.\nTheir confidence is usually placed on a leader figure and this makes them eager to please but also terrified to fail. They need to learn to trust in their own capabilities to reach their full potential.\n \rfunction appendToC(){\rvar natureList = Object.values(document.getElementsByClassName(\"Nature\")).map(n = n.children[0].innerText);\rvar toc = document.getElementById(\"TableOfContents\");\rif(toc!=null){\rvar natureTocList = document.createElement(\"UL\");\rnatureList.forEach( id = {\rvar textNode = document.createTextNode(id);\rvar urlNode = document.createElement(\"A\");\rurlNode.setAttribute(\"href\", \"#\"+id);\rurlNode.appendChild(textNode);\rvar listNode = document.createElement(\"LI\");\rlistNode.appendChild(urlNode);\rnatureTocList.appendChild(listNode);\r});\rtoc.children[0].lastElementChild.appendChild(natureTocList);\r}\r}\rwindow.addEventListener(\"load\", appendToC);\r  ","description":"羅列各性格的說明和對應數值","id":17,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"性格","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/natures/"},{"content":"Skills and Extras You will be needing Skills to make your adventure easier and help you go through many situations.

Although the most relevant are listed in the Character Sheets, you may learn anything you want, from farming to poetry or anything you can imagine. Use EXTRA skills to take note of any other Skill not listed by default.\nKeep in mind that most Pokémon will need a Trainer\u0026rsquo;s instruction to learn Skills not listed on their character sheet.\nSkills can only be rolled alongside an Attribute, never on their own.\nEach Skill Point will be a dice added to the roll whenever you need more than your natural physical, mental or social power to succeed.\nMost Action Rolls require an: Attribute + Skill\nMake combinations to get a dice pool that fits the action you are trying to do.

Marco has a total HP of 6.\nMarco’s Marowak has a Base HP of 4, and its Vitality score is 4.\nMarowak’s total HP is 8.\n\nWhenever you receive damage, you will lose HP.\nThis HP loss is only temporary and can be recovered with time or medicine. If you receive damage equal your total HP, you will be unable to move and you\u0026rsquo;ll faint.\nIf you keep receiving damage after fainting, that damage will become Lethal. That means your wounds will be more severe and your life could be in danger.\nSome Moves performed by Pokémon may deal Lethal Damage directly.\nReceiving Lethal Damage equal to your total HP means the character dies.\nWill Points Through history, people have achieved great feats that normally would seem impossible.\nA frail woman suddenly lifting a giant boulder to save her infant son trapped underneath, or a man with a broken leg getting up to run from a fire.\nIn those scenarios, people used all of their might, breaking the limits of their own physical restrictions in order achieve something greater.\nThe Will Attribute measures just how far your inner strength can take you.\nEvery human and Pokémon has Will equal to: Insight +2. Storyteller may call for players and Pokémon to make a roll using their Will score to overcome fear, rage, or sadness, also as a call for conscience when attempting misdeeds. Will points can also be spent to resist pain and have a better chance to succeed at any roll.\nHere is how it works:\nAnnounce that your character or Pokémon are giving all they’ve got.\n Spend 1 Will Point to ignore 1 Pain/Stress Penalization for the rest of the scene.\nNote: This means that if you spend 2 Will Points you\u0026rsquo;ll ignore 2 Pain Penalizations and so on. Spend 1 Will Point to reroll 1 unsuccessful die from all your Rolls during this Round.  \nAfter you spend a point, however, your character will be worn out, if you run out of Will Points the character will lose consciousness and faint at the end of the Round. Just from the sheer strain of going beyond the limit.\nPokémon and Humans do not come to this world with the ability to spend Will Points whenever they want.\nIt is something that creatures would use only in extreme situations, and even then, most people just don’t have what it takes.\nThe Trainer has to teach his Pokémon to get a hold of this inner strength. Maybe later they will be able to use the power of their Will.\nIf a Trainer is not experienced in using his or her own inner strength, it is possible the Pokémon won’t be either. Most of the non-player characters will not use their Will Points as it is something only the most proficient Trainers and Pokémon are able to do.\nTo recover one spent Will Point your character must:\nRest for a few days, feel accomplished by having achieved something great, follow their nature, or get them as a reward for good role-play\n","description":"說明生命值(HP)和意志點(WP)的意義和用途","id":21,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"生命值與意志點","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/starting-the-game/hp-wp/"},{"content":"Happiness \u0026amp; Loyalty These attributes will define your relationship with your Pokémon and are among the most valuable traits in the game since they determine how good is your relationship with your companions.\nWhat’s the use of a strong Pokémon if it hates you and wants to run away?\nIt is common for trainers to have a hard time with a newly caught Pokémon, they might even be attacked by said Pokémon since for all they know this is just Round two. This kind of reaction depends on the situation in which the Pokémon was caught but also depends on the species and their nature.\nThe best tip we can give you: Try to start with the right foot.\nHappiness and Loyalty range from 0 to 5 points.\nIn the wild, a Pokémon usually has 2 points on each, but as soon as they are caught their life changes forever.\nA good trainer must know how to deal with rough edges if he plans on building a relationship and hopefully, increase these two traits.\nAs soon as you catch a Pokémon, reduce their Loyalty by the same amount as the Pain penalization you inflicted on them. Yeah, that’s right. If you beat them to a pulp, don’t expect them to be happy about it.\nWhen you catch a Pokémon, reduce their happiness to 0 points if they were caught against their will, to 1 if the battle against them was unfair (many vs. one, using items etc.) and keep it at 2 ifyou fought them in fair conditions.\nThese two traits cannot be increased with the Ranking system. You will need to role play if you want to affect them both positively or negatively.\nWhile Happiness and Loyalty are not directly linked, keeping your Pokémon happy is a good way to gain or increase its Loyalty.\nRole-Playing will be the key to increase both traits.\nAim to build a strong relationship with your Pokémon while it’s still at an un-evolved stage.\nCreating bonds with Pokémon in later stages will be a lot harder.\r Happiness This trait is all about being happy and comfortable. Most Pokémon are simple creatures, they want safety, food, stability and especially they want to feel useful.\nSome Pokémon will rejoice in the comfort and luxuries of the human world, while others will disregard them.\nAlways try to provide the life they want.\n\r○○○○○ Miserable. Your Pokémon is angry and/or depressed, it may resent you or others. \r●○○○○ Dissatisfied. The Pokémon doesn’t like living with you. \r●●○○○ Comfortable. There’s food, companionship and a place to sleep, it’s not bad. \r●●●○○ Satisfied. Your Pokémon enjoys the benefits that come with being your companion. \r●●●●○ Accomplished. Most of what your Pokémon wanted in life has come by being with you. \r●●●●● True Happiness. Life has been kind to this Pokémon and it is grateful to you for it. \r\rLoyalty This trait reflects how much they are willing to do for you; from ignoring you completely to risking their lives to save you, a loyal Pokémon is your best friend in better or worst. Never underestimate the power of friendship.\nPokémon evolution may bring a power surge that makes them feel they don\u0026rsquo;t need you as much anymore, so their Loyalty score may go down upon evolving.\nEvolution might strain the relationship you had with your Pokémon, making it feel as if it were a stranger.\nWhen a Pokémon evolves, roll their Trainer\u0026rsquo;s highest Social Attribute.\nScore at least 2 Successes, or else the Loyalty of the Pokémon will go down 1 point. \r○○○○○ The Pokémon thinks about attacking you or escaping. Careful as it might bite. \r●○○○○ It is indifferent to you, it may not even want to interact with you or your other Pokémon. \r●●○○○ It will stay by your side. But If it gets too dangerous you are on your own. \r●●●○○ The Pokémon considers you a friend, it will help you get out of danger if possible. \r●●●●○ There is nothing it wouldn’t do for you. You are the most important person. \r●●●●● Some friendships last more than a lifetime.

Some will flee in fear, others will get aggressive and do everything to protect themselves from what they see as a threat to their survival.\nWild Pokémon have honed skills of survival that human-raised Pokémon do not have. Also, there are species that have not been tamed nor domesticated due to their formidable strength. Catching one of these specimens would give you an advantage over the other trainers; And they can teach you as much about teamwork, nature and following your instincts as you can teach them about the human world.\nHabitats The world of Pokémon is big, if not bigger than ours. There are places where certain kinds of Pokémon are drawn to, and there are Pokémon that can only be found in certain parts of the globe.\nExperienced Trainers don’t go around the world throwing Pokéballs at everything that moves. They study the habitats of the Pokémon and seek for a specimen that seems good-natured or try to gain the trust and respect of a Pokémon that seems especially wary.\nSome Pokémon are so rare that people don’t know if they are real or legends. To find them, trainers have to venture into uncharted areas.\r Special Pokémon Around the world, there are Pokémon that do not fit their species stereotypes. While every Pokémon is unique, these Pokémon have special qualities to them that can make them literally one in a million. Traits like a different color pattern, a bigger size and even moves or abilities that defy their nature.\n⬛ Shiny Pokémon, Alternate Forms \u0026amp; Regional Variants. Some Pokémon have a different coloration in their fur, hide, feathers or scales. This change can be aesthetic or it can involve a change in Typing, Attribute Limits, Moves and/or Abilities.\nShiny Pokémon are distinguished by the sparkles they leave behind as if they were coated in a glittery dust. Their exotic look makes them highly appreciated in beauty contests and people will pay incredibly high amounts of money to get their hands on one, their appearance does not affect their Type or Attributes.\nAlternate Forms refer to Pokémon of the same species that somehow look different from each other although with some resemblance still. They can have different Types, Attributes and Abilities.\nSome Pokémon may even change forms at will.\nRegional Variants are Alternate forms of Pokémon that can only be found in certain regions, they are the result of introducing foreign Pokémon into an established habitat, over the generations the Pokémon have to adapt to this new environment, this can make them change their type, abilities, move set and even make evolve into something their regular counterparts cannot.\n⬛ Overgrown Pokémon Most Pokémon have a standard size and weight, but there are reported cases of Pokémon that could be considered giants within their own species. Overgrown Pokémon are usually around 30% to 60% bigger than their regular-sized counterparts but they are very rare to find. Their main characteristic is that their size and weight keep proportion.\nMany trainers have overfed their Pokémon with the hopes of making them bigger, only to end up making them fatter. An overgrown Pokémon is born that way. Even if at birth it has a normal size, it will keep growing until it reaches maturity.\nOvergrown Pokémon have a higher Base HP than their regular-sized counterparts.\nIncrease their Base HP by 1\r⬛ Hidden Moves and Abilities There are records in this world’s history that depict certain Pokémon using powers and Abilities different from those normally seen on them.\nOnly a few proficient trainers like Gym Leaders and Elites are known for owning at least one of this Special Pokémon.\nHowever, it is unknown if they captured their Pokémon with those rare abilities or somehow they worked with them to attain them.\nStoryteller\u0026rsquo;s discretion should be applied for Pokémon to have Moves and/or Abilities it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t normally have.\nUsing Pokéballs If you want to catch a Wild Pokémon, you are gonna need Pokéballs. You can buy them at any Pokémart. Greatballs and Ultraballs can be more expensive than a regular Pokéball, but in the end, they can save you money by not breaking apart when you need to capture a powerful Pokémon.\nWhen you capture a Pokémon within a Pokéball, the chip will be branded with your Trainer’s ID. That way other Trainer’s Pokéballs won’t be able to trap your Pokémon to steal it.\nPokéballs can’t carry Humans, rooted objects like trees or mountain boulders, machinery that contains a lot of small pieces such as motor vehicles and electronics.\nBig objects like tents, bicycles, and potions in bulk are sold with their own Pokéball for easy storage. Once a Pokéball is used to carry something inside it gets coded into it and cannot carry anything else. Just like with Pokémon, the item it carries will have your ID number and can be retrieved back to you through a computer in case you lose them or want to store them.\n⬛ Catch Roll The main use of Pokéballs is catching Pokémon, they all have a seal you need to roll for the catch to be a success:\nItemSeal Potency\rPokeball 4 dice\rGreatball 6 dice\rUltraball 8 dice\r\rInflicting damage or a Status Ailments will modify your Catch Roll. These Bonuses Stack with each other, giving you up to +3 extra successes to your Catch Roll. You lose ALL Bonus Successes against a Fainted Pokémon.\nWild Pokémon's ConditionBonus Successes\rPokémon is at half HP 1\rPokémon is at 1 HP 1\rPokémon has a Status Ailment 1\r\rStronger Pokémon are harder to catch, this is why you must score a number of successes that varies with their Rank:\nPokémon's RankRequired Successes\rStarter3\rBeginner4\rAmateur6\rAce8\rProfessional9\r\rIf you don\u0026rsquo;t score the Required Successes, the Pokémon breaks free and the Pokéball is rendered unusable. Leslie found a wild Clefairy!\nAfter a fierce battle, she damaged Clefairy down to half its maximum HP. It is time to use a Pokéball!\nShe throws the Pokéball and rolls:\n{@icon dice|m|4} Pokéball\u0026rsquo;s Dicepool\n+ 1 Success (Clefairy’s at Half HP)\nCatch Roll: {@icon rdice|s|4}{@icon rdice|s|5}{@icon rdice|s|2}{@icon rdice|s|1}\nLeslie scored 3 success. Since this Clefairy\u0026rsquo;s Ranking is at Starter. That means\u0026hellip;\nLeslie caught a wild Clefairy!\n Inflicting damage on a Pokémon will reduce its Happiness and Loyalty; don\u0026rsquo;t expect a Pokémon you just beat into a pulp to be a happy and compliant partner.\nOther Pokémon take pride in proving themselves and handle their defeat against you gracefully.\nYou may also try and convince a Pokémon to come into adventures with you, no harm in trying.\nA friendly approach may win you their loyalty, although some Pokémon are picky as to whom they allow to train them.\nPokémon with a higher Rank than a Trainer won\u0026rsquo;t obey commands and cannot be a part of Training Sessions. If they were caught forcefully, they may even try to escape! If a recently captured Pokémon dislikes you, try to be understanding and compensate for it.\nBuilding a relationship with your Pokémon is one of the main aspects for this game.\n⬛ Special Pokéballs Decades ago, to obtain a Pokéball you had to search for a special kind of fruit called Apricorn and craft the item yourself. It was a long and arduous process that took several days. Back then, you REALLY had to work hard to catch a Pokémon.\nNowdays the Pokéball industry is constantly innovating and offering a variety of products for the diligent Trainer.\nThese Pokéballs have special effects on the Pokémon you catch with them or offer specialization when catching Pokémon that meet certain criteria.\nThey are limited editions and are usually not found on sale, but when they are, they are not cheap.\n{@icon ball|m|premier}\rPremier Ball\rThese are a sign of status, other trainers might respect you more if you use them.\r\r\r{@icon ball|m|luxury}\rLuxury Ball\rMoney CAN buy Pokémon happiness; the trait will improve if you catch them with this ball. \r\r{@icon ball|m|cherish}\rCherish Ball\rThis Ball is only handed to those who have ties or work directly in the League.\r\r\r{@icon ball|m|ub}\rUB-Ball\rA ball specially designed by the Aether foundation for their UB-Project.\r\r\r{@icon ball|m|dynamax}\rDynamax- Ball\rGalar scientist's pride, this virtual pokeball can create giant holograms that feel real.\r\r\r{@icon ball|m|master}\rMaster Ball\rSilph co. star project, rumor has it that it's capable of catching ANY Pokémon without fail.\r\r\rThere\u0026rsquo;s is a large variety of Pokéballs, finding all of them and their effects is one of the aspects of Pokémon catching. If you manage to learn how to craft your own Pokéballs you\u0026rsquo;ll gain an edge over other Trainers and save lots of money.\nOther ways to obtain Pokémon ⬛ Buying Pokémon Pokémon Breeding is a respected profession where people dedicate their lives to raise and nurture Pokémon that aid humans in their activities. Many of these professionally bred Pokémon can be bought, ensuring certain traits such as a non-aggressive nature, a good disposition for work, and even special moves.\nBuying Pokémon is a luxury, though. Their cost range from tens of thousands to even millions of pokédollars. Especially if the bred Pokémon is rare to find in the wild or hard to tame. You can also find common Pokémon for sale for a few hundred pokédollars in less reputable places, but it is up to you to trust this kind of establishments.\n⬛ Adopting Pokémon All around the world, there are abandoned Pokémon. Most of the time they are abandoned for being weak, rebellious or afraid of battles. Whatever the case these Pokémon need to be to taken care of.\nSome shelters located outside the cities look after them until another trainer wants to adopt them. Abandoned Pokémon have their own story to tell and many are wary of humans. If you give them respect and good care they may become your most loyal companions.\nAdopting is free for all registered trainers.\nIf you see a shelter, take a look inside, perhaps you’ll find the Pokémon you were looking for.\nAdopting a Pokémon is a good way to start your Adventure. However, many times they do not have the best attitude or an easy Nature.\r ⬛ Trading Pokémon Sometimes a Pokémon was not what you were expecting. Maybe you have too many Pokémon of the same species or maybe you want to get rid of a bad pet.\nInstead of abandoning them, why don’t you trade them? There are lots of trainers traveling from one city to another looking for a new Pokémon.\nIf you find someone willing to trade you one Pokémon in exchange for another, head to the nearest Pokémon center, put your pokéballs on the machine and wait for the process to complete.\nThe chip on your Pokémon will still name you as their original trainer but they will be now on the property of another trainer.\nBe careful as Pokémon you trade will take more time to adjust to their new trainer. Whenever you trade a Pokémon it will lose 1 point of Happiness and Loyalty, even if it is your original Pokémon you’re getting back.\n⬛ Releasing Pokémon There are times when there is no other option, your Pokémon is not happy living with humans or you find that your time together has come to an end.\nYou can simply let your Pokémon out of its Pokéball on its new home and leave it there, within a few weeks of not being recalled and not being close to its Pokéball the chip on your Pokémon will deactivate and another trainer will be able to catch it. Another way is going to a computer and manually deactivate the chip and ID of your Pokémon, then allow the machine to transport and release it on a secure location.\nIt is always sad to see a companion go, and abandoning a Pokémon for shallow reasons is frowned upon in the Pokémon League community.\nPokémon are sensitive creatures and abandonment takes a toll on their emotions and ability to trust humans.\nBe a responsible Trainer and don’t capture Pokémon you don’t intend to take care properly. Make sure you only release a Pokémon that wants to be released.\n","description":"","id":24,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"收服寶可夢","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/catching-pokemon/"},{"content":"Rolling the Dice Our lives are influenced by random factors all the time. Luck is a part of our lives, fortune can change our future and destiny is built on the results of our actions.\nIn Pokémon: The Role Playing Game all variables are represented by six-sided dice. These Dice are pretty easy to get and you can find them in almost any gaming store. You may even have some from your old board games!\nYou will need to roll the dice to perform any action you can imagine.\nDuring the course of the story, your character will have to perform certain actions that are out of the ordinary.\nNow that you have seen the Attributes and Skills, it’s time to learn about how to use them.\nUnless it’s something simple, every Action roll is an ensemble of an Attribute and a Skill. The total sum of the points your character has in those traits is the final dice pool for the action.\nRoll those dice and every dice that comes up as 4, 5 or 6 counts as a success.\nYou might require 1, 2, 3 or more successes from this roll depending on the difficulty of the task.\n\r Required Successes  Difficulty Settings \r 1 Troublesome. You rarely do something like this. \r 2 Challenging. You have obstacles in your way. \r 3 Hard. The conditions place you at a huge disadvantage. \r 4 Insane. The mere idea of trying is ridiculous. \r 5+ Almost Impossible. All logic points to the action not being possible. \r\rWilson is chasing a Murkrow who stole his Trainer bag.\nMurkrow is slowed due to the bag\u0026rsquo;s weight and thus not able to fly high enough.\nThis makes the task pretty easy and Willson\u0026rsquo;s roll only needs 1 Success to get the thief.\nLater that day, a Honchkrow comes and steals his bag (again!) since it is stronger, it\u0026rsquo;s not being slowed down and Wilson\u0026rsquo;s roll will need 3 successes. If he doesn\u0026rsquo;t catch it on his first attempt and Honchkrow starts to fly higher, his roll will progresively increase in difficulty, until Honchkrow gets out of reach and flies away\n Critical Failure What would happen if you try to get a 4 year-old to land a plane during an emergency? Probably nothing good.\nUnderperforming when attempting a task can bring catastrofic results. That is why if you score a roll with less than 3 successes than required you will not just fail to do the task, but something bad will happen at your Storyteller\u0026rsquo;s discretion.\n Receiving Damage Damaging an ally Making the task completely impossible Getting an Status Ailment \u0026hellip;or worse.  That means that tasks that are Troublesome, or Challenging can be attempted safely, but as soon as the difficulty becomes Hard the possibilities of suffering injury or having disastrous consequences are very real.\nThe farther your roll is to the required successes, the worse the outcome will be.\n","description":"說明擲骰判定的相關規則","id":25,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"擲骰","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/starting-the-game/rolling-dice/"},{"content":"Training Pokemon Training Sessions Pokémon training is probably the most fundamental aspect of becoming stronger.\nA training session usually takes 2 hours of your day within the game. During this time you work with your Pokémon, you try to understand their ways, their motives, their strengths and weaknesses. Before attempting to teach them something new, you have to bond with them, especially if they are newly caught. This way you can raise their Loyalty and Happiness.\nOnce everything is said and done, present your Pokémon with simple and entertaining physical and mental activities like games, puzzles, item gathering, weight lifting, etc. You can get as creative as you want, just remember that some Pokémon may require special attention.\nTraining a Pokémon requires patience and lots of work. You will need to get better in your own skills if you want to be a better Pokémon Trainer.\nYou may teach a Pokémon by using your different skills.\nOnce you are ready, you can choose how to strengthen your Pokémon.\nTom has been working with his team, a Jigglypuff, a Lillipup and newly caught Oddish and wants to increase their speed, so he’s staring a routine where all his Pokémon run laps.\nWeeks later, Oddish has evolved and in preparation for it to evolve again it will need lots of sunlight and nourishment, Tom knows about gardening and goes to a store to buy some fertilizer to treat Gloom with it.\nThere are many ways to Train a Pokémon, it just needs a little bit of imagination!\n ⬛ Rank Up The most essential job of a Trainer is to raise powerful and happy Pokémon. Your Starter will be the same Rank as you when you start the game, but once you increase your Rank, you will have to Rank-Up all Pokémon you have. Some wild Pokémon might seem weak but with you as a Trainer they will become champion material in no time!\nDepending on the technique used to train a Pokémon,\nRoll an Attribute/Social Attribute + Lore\nafter a Training Session.\nOnce you score the required successes, the Pokémon Rank is raised by one level (ex. from Beginner to Amateur).\nRankRequired Successes\rto Beginner 3 \rto Amateur 6 \rto Ace 12 \rto Pro 24 \rto Master 36 \rto Champion 48 \r\rYou cannot raise a Pokémon’s Rank beyond your own, and Training Rolls are done only once per day.\nTo fully Rank Up a Pokémon, you need several days.\n⬛ Retrain Most Trainers won’t get it right on the first try. Considering there are hundreds of different species, whatever works for a Pokémon might not work for another, so, it is possible for a Trainer to rethink their strategy and retrain a companion. Doing so it’s a lot easier than Ranking Up a newly caught Pokémon.\nYou may use the Training Session to Retrain instead of Ranking Up. If so, simply:\nRoll an Attribute/Social Attribute + Lore\nafter a Training Session.\nOnce you score 3 Successes, you get several benefits:\n Redistribute all Attributes and Social Attributes awarded by Rank. Redistribute all Skill Points awarded by Rank. Assign all Skill Points from a Rank, before assigning all Skill Points from the next Rank. Pokémon may forget Moves and learn new Moves from available Ranks. Forgotten Moves exclusive to previous Evolutions are lost forever.  Remember, Training Rolls are done only once per day.\n⬛ Training a Disobedient Pokémon You cannot train a Pokémon of higher Rank than your own. Perhaps the disobedient Pokémon simply wants to do things its own way or maybe it’s is not paying attention deliberately. For whatever reason, you haven’t earned its respect.\nChristine is just a Beginner but has two Pokémon on her team, her starter Pidgey, and a recently caught Persian.\nThey are gathered for a group Training Session.\nThe trio begins by playing Dodgeball. But during today’s game only Pidgey followed Christine’s commands. When Christine threw the ball, Persian quickly crushed it with its fangs and went away to sleep under a tree.\nThis Persian’s Rank is Amateur.This means Christine’s skill is simply not enough to handle this Pokémon.\nPersian won’t be obeying orders anytime soon.\n Evolve your Pokémon Evolving a Pokémon is hard work, it requires hours and hours of Training or years of struggle, but when it finally happens, your companions will get a lot stronger.\nThe amount of training required to Evolve a Pokémon varies from species to species. Bug-Type Pokémon tend to Evolve quickly, while Dragon Pokémon take ages.\nPokémon may evolve for several reasons, some Evolve to survive in a hostile environment, others Evolve thanks to age and experience, others change when subjected to materials or energies. See a Pokémon’s Entry for details.\n⬛ Evolve through Battle Experience Most Pokémon evolve after battling quite a lot. If you’re interested on getting your companions to their Final Form, pay attention to their Battles and their ability to win.\nOnce a Pokémon has met the required number of Victories, it will begin its transformation.\nEach species evolves at different rates, described as Evolution Time. Follow this simple chart:\nEvolution TimeRequired Victories\rFast 5 \rMedium 15 \rSlow 45 \r\rNewly caught Pokémon may already have some Victories under their belt.\nWhen a Pokémon Evolves, use their New Pokédex Entry as a Template and distribute all bonuses from Rank just as you would when Retraining. ⬛ Overranking When a Pokémon is ready to Evolve, you may choose to stop the Evolution by making it snap out of the trance. If you do, a Pokémon retains some of the power it tapped from the process.\nThe Pokémon gains access to 1 Move from a Rank higher than its own! This means an Amateur Ranked Pokémon may have 1 Move from Ace Rank.\nThere is a problem, though, a Pokémon resets the Victory count to zero, so, if it wants to Evolve, it must start all over again. Also, a Pokémon may not have more than one Overranked Move at a time.\nFinal Forms may benefit from Overranking too, once they achieve 20 Victories, they get access to one and only one Move from a Higher Rank.\n⬛ The Limits of a Pokémon Pokémon bodies are quite different to human bodies, therefore, they have different capabilities too. Some can be stronger, faster, or sturdier. To reach the full capacity of development on the body is what we call: Limits.\nA human has a Limit of 5 points in all attributes, that means that when you reach 5 points, you have developed the attribute maximum for a human.\nThe Pokémon’s Limits are different for each species and tend to increase with evolution.\nEven if a Pokémon’s Limit may not seem very high, remember that all Pokémon posses an attribute that no human has: Special. This, alongside the moves they can learn is what allows them to do incredible feats that humans will never be able to.\nIf we compare the difference of Limits in Strength of a human and a Tyrogue, we would have:\n Human’s Strength: ●●○○○ Tyrogue’s Strength: ●○○  This means that even if Tyrogue reached its full Limit in Strength, it would not be stronger than a very fit human with 4 or more points in that attribute.\nBut if that same Tyrogue evolves into a Hitmonlee, the Strength limit compared to a human would be:\n Human’s Strength: ●●○○○ Hitmonlee’s Strength: ●●●○○○○  Tyrogue’s Evolution obtains a potential that not even the strongest human could ever match.\n ⬛ Teaching New Moves, Forgetting old ones. Pokémon are able to learn incredibly good Moves, train hard and show them the real arsenal at their disposal.\nWhen you Retrain a Pokémon it is able able to forget a Move they already know to try out something new. When your Pokémon forgets a Move you may pick a new Move from your Rank or lower.\nHowever, if your Pokémon forgets a Move exclusive to its previous Evolution, it will NOT be able to get it back.\nRemember that your Pokémon has a limit of Moves it can learn equal to: Insight + 2.\n⬛ Move Tutors Some people are even capable of teaching moves that are not usually known by some species. They are called Move Tutors.\nThese amazing trainers are retired fighters, mystic people or great elders from far away lands. Their secrets are kept away from strangers, but sometimes they take Pokémon as pupils to teach them their ancient techniques.\nShould you meet one of them, show respect and maybe they’ll teach you in exchange for a favor.\n⬛ Day-Care Centers There are establishments that give care and training to Pokémon when their owners are too busy or simply do not have the skills necessary to raise a Pokémon. Think about them as obedience schools for pets in the real world.\nThey’ll raise and discipline your Pokémon, charging you for every day it stays in their facilities. In the Day-Care, your Pokémon will be fed, bathed, socialized and educated. When you get it back, the number of Required Victories to Evolve may be reduced at the Storyteller’s discretion.\nRemember that a well-behaved Pokémon is not always equal to a happy or loyal Pokémon.\n","description":"","id":26,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"訓練寶可夢","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/training-pokemon/"},{"content":"Ranking Even Champions were rookies at a certain point in their lives.\nToday you begin your Pokémon Journey. Many adventures lie ahead. Perhaps you always dreamt on becoming a Trainer, or maybe some circumstances forced you to take this path. If you\u0026rsquo;re willing to work hard, someday you may even become the best.\nA good Trainer is capable of taking a little scaredy Pokémon and turn it into a champion, but in order to do that, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to journey across the world and complete many achievements.\nRank determines your ability to train a Pokémon and it represents your overall personal growth.\nWhen it comes to Ranking, you’re teaching your Pokémon how to fight and survive, but you\u0026rsquo;re also teaching them how to unleash their potential, control their most advanced Moves and to adjust to any strategy you need.\nThe Ranking System works through Achievements.\nWhen a Trainer completes all the achievements required to upgrade, them and all their trained Pokémon will gain the Benefits.\nStoryteller may add or change achievements required to improve a Trainer\u0026rsquo;s Rank. Starter Rank You begin your career right here, a newbie without any real experience. Most wild Pokémon won\u0026rsquo;t listen to you and even your own Pokémon will have a hard time understanding anything that doesn’t fit their primitive instincts as you simply don\u0026rsquo;t have enough idea of your Pokémon\u0026rsquo;s potential.\nWhat Achievements do I need to get this Rank?

Can raise Attributes up to 2 Points beyond the Limit. 1 more Skill Point to distribute.  Overall, Rank is a representation of time and effort put into a particular lifestyle, Pokémon Training in this case.\nWild Pokémon also have a Rank and obtain the benefits from it, it\u0026rsquo;s up to the Storyteller\u0026rsquo;s discretion to determine the Rank of a wild Pokémon.\nPokémon will not follow orders from a Trainer with a Rank inferior to theirs. So if you catch or trade a Pokémon with a Rank superior to yours, its Rank will remain as it is, making it almost impossible for you to control or make it obey you.\nThe League does not look favorably on trainers who cannot control their Pokémon in official matches.\nTrainers who seem incapable of controlling their Pokémon during a tournament or an official match are disqualified.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll have to increase your abilities as a Trainer to fully tame and unleash a stronger Pokémon\u0026rsquo;s potential.\nThe good news is that if you catch or obtain a Pokémon with a Rank lower than your own, its Rank will be upgraded to match yours after some Training Sessions.\nBecause your Rank is also a reflection of your mastery, you also learned how to get the best out of a Pokémon. Now you are able to generate results faster.\n","description":"說明訓練家等級的意義和效果","id":28,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"等級","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/starting-the-game/ranking/"},{"content":"Creating a Story Now it’s time to derail the train of destiny with some booms and bams!

Just remember that you are here to make sure that everyone is having fun.\nTo start, talk to your players and ask them how they wish to play, what they expect from the story, and what their perceptions of the Pokémon world are.\nYou have to unify their perception to make sure their characters are being brought to life with a clear idea about how this society works and their attitude towards Pokémon and other humans. You can even share a brief summary of what’s to come.\nListen to their concerns and also express your own.\nRemember that it is also their responsibility to create fun characters that can contribute to the story.\nSomeone who antagonizes other players or the storyteller is not doing their job as a player correctly.

A Chronicle is a grand adventure with one main plot and usually one recurring villain. This kind of story can get really epic and can take months of gaming sessions.\nIt was made a common belief that this kind of storytelling was the normal mode to play, however, it is not.\nThis is hard mode.\nIt’s common to see people start a Chronicle and never finish it, so keep it simple.\nCommunication between players and storyteller makes all the difference.\nEpisodic Picture it like watching a TV Show, a single session is a complete adventure on its own. Many things could change for better or worse, however, let it be powerful. Allow the players to learn something from it. The fact that they can return to their normal lives doesn’t mean they went home empty-handed.\nIt is possible to begin to play in an Episodic way and then throw some Chronicle elements.\nStoryteller Rotation Storyteller Rotation has a great advantage due to many people taking turns at storytelling. The characters will be provided with many more kinds of adventures because everyone has a unique way of thinking.\nStorytellers may take a break and also play their characters and there’s more time to write better adventures.\nIt’s like watching a series of movies telling the comings and goings of the Characters. It is very similar to a normal Chronicle that is combined with Episodic Storytelling.\n\nAll Players should\u0026hellip; Go with the flow Stay in character and actively role-play, so instead of saying: “I send out my dragon pokémon and I order it to attack or whatever\u0026hellip;” Act as if your character was really in the situation and say: “Garchop, go! Charge using Dragon rush!” So don\u0026rsquo;t be shy and let\u0026rsquo;s have fun!\nStay Focused Sometimes not much is happening, or maybe your character is not on the scene. Be calm, listen, and stay focused. Paying attention when the storyteller is speaking is a common courtesy. It will make the game flow faster and smoother.\nWork as a Team The other players are members of your group, you should be friendly to them and their characters. You guys are a team and should work as such. Antagonizing other party members for your own amusement is disruptive and disrespectful. Don’t be THAT guy.\nRequest Goals Are you trying to defeat the Gym leaders? Exploring old ruins full of strange Pokémon? Make characters to fit that goal. If for some reason you are at a loss of what to do, you should ask the Storyteller to do a retell on the important plot points.\nNot obsess about rules and mechanics Remember that the Storyteller will decide what’s appropriate in the story. If there is a conflict or a stalemate use common sense and prioritize the story flow over anything else.\nTry out Storytelling! Everyone has the ability to tell a story, we want to encourage you to try it from time to time.\nIt’s a wonderful experience and it’s easier than you’d think.\nWe’re sure you can do it!\nLaws of Storytelling   Don’t create a story to win\nThis is not about how you are going to defeat the players.\n  Don’t fret over minuscule details\nYour job is to create a mood, an atmosphere. You don’t have to describe where every single object is. Let their imaginations do the work, this will save time and make the game flow uninterrupted.\n  Help the players get into their characters\nPlayers are not really inside the Pokémon world. Don’t expect them to perform as you imagined. Try to tell them how their characters feel and what they are thinking. It’s useful to place thoughts in them from time to time.\n  The game is not only about mechanics\nThis game is about active role-playing, don’t get too deep into the numbers, the rules, and pop-up combat. It’s never as important as the drama.\n  Actively Role-Play\nThis game requires active role-playing. You are not only preparing to tell a story, you are also getting prepared for acting. The same law applies to the Players. Add spice by describing the actions and the Moves of their Characters and Pokémon in the game.\n  Use tools\nEven if you have a beautiful voice, use appropriate music and sound effects. You may print maps or show your players pictures of the places they are in. This will help everyone to be in the same tune and will make your story a lot more interesting.\n  Get prepared\nIt’s not ok to walk into the room not knowing what you are going to say. Improvisation can only take you so far.\n  Use Time\nUse time in your favor. You can use Flashbacks, Fast-Forwards, or Pause the session if you need some time to think. Taking breaks is always nice.\n  Make sure everyone is having fun\nYou are not their entertainer, but you have to make sure everyone is taking part in the story. From the most talkativeand extrovert to the most shy and timid of your players.\n  Start as close to the end as possible\nLong introductions are boring. Even If there is something very important from the past, try to use exposition to say it.\n  Make it feel real not “realistic”\nTo bring your adventures to life you must have fun with the innocence and fantasy of the game.\n  Don’t create a story to win. Again.\nJust to be clear.\n  The storyteller is not “God”\nYou’ll always have the final word, but don’t let the power fool you. If you think you can do whatever you want, you’ll find yourself without players very soon\n  Tips on Storytelling Improvise There will be times your players suggest something wild or illogic. Try not to say “No” if they suggest it, it must be because they find it fun. Roll with it, improvise and try to make it fit into the setting and story.\nPrepare Random Encounters Sometimes players get to a point you didn’t expect, so prepare some bad dudes and their Pokémon. This should be used only when it’s really necessary, not as part of your story. If you don’t use this Encounter in the game session, save it for later.\nGive Emergency clues Many times Players will miss a VERY CRUCIAL clue. Maybe it was right under their nose, but now they can’t go any further without it or the story will take a bitter turn. In such cases, you may have to move the clue from place to place in case it is needed. Maybe it’s time to use the random encounter or have an ally appear.\nPrioritize story flow over puzzles and mechanics.\nPositive reinforcement Perhaps your Players are getting out of character or being disruptive. Keep Calm. Talk to them.\nDon’t punish your players in-game for something that’s happening out of it. Engage them, give them goals and reward their achievements. You may also try converting the interactions and comments they make out-of-game to in-game. The results may surprise you.\n","description":"說明該如何創作精彩的冒險故事","id":29,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"創作故事","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/starting-the-game/create-story/"},{"content":"Pokedex There are almost a thousand known species of Pokémon in the world, some better known than others.\nIn this section of the book you’ll find all the information available about most of them.\nTo create and train your Pokémon you’ll need to check its Pokédex entry, Ability and Moves in the Pokémon Abilities and Pokémon Moves sections of this book.\nNow, this might seem like a lot of information to take in. How will you ever memorize all these names, data, Moves and special Abilities?\nDon’t worry! You don’t have to memorize it at all! Simply take this information to customize your Pokémon and build a unique character.\nThink of your Pokémon as an extension of your Trainer’s abilities. Pokémon work like powers at your disposition. If you want Ice powers you should capture an Ice Pokémon. If you want to be a bard, get a Pokémon with Sing.\r Your Pokémon are capable of working wonders with ease. They have many abilities and maybe a dozen moves to learn. Focus only on what you want.\nThink about it this way: You have 6 slots available for customization.\nEach and every Pokémon you carry will have a special role in your party. You can complement your team any way you want.\nPerhaps you want a bulky Pokémon that can take a hit or a fast companion to sweep an enemy party, a cute kitten who’s only there to charm the girls or a passionate mouse to cheer everyone’s fighting spirit.\nYour imagination is the limit.\n\rUse the tools on this book and your imagination to create unique Pokémon. They are part of a living world, take your time and describe their behaviors.\r\nKeep in mind that a Pokémon’s uniqueness is not in its Strength or its high Attributes, but in the role playing you get from your players thanks to it.\r\nForm Variations A few Pokémon have different looks even when they are the same species. Sometimes this change is merely aesthetic, other times they evolve into a variant and cannot change back. And other times a certain move or item triggers these changes.\nSome of these variants can only be found in certain parts of the world. The different forms may change their attribute Limit distribution, grant them a new power and/or change their Type.\nFor Mega-Evolution your trainer will have to meet certain conditions for the form to be stable and long-lasting.\nMake sure to read all the entries on the different Form Variations of these Pokémon.\nShould one of your Pokémon change forms, during the game, it is convenient to have the character sheets of all its Form variations.\nEach Form would have its own set of Attributes and points on them according to your Rank, even if they are different from each other.\nYou may use your own discretion as to what triggers the changes on certain Pokémon. It may be an Item, energy or perhaps they are able to change at will.\r A Note on World Building This world is vast and extense with many regions to explore. It is very easy to get carried away, wanting to start really big, however, we recommend you start small.\nStart in a town or a Small city, let the world expand in the direction your players want to explore rather than putting them on a big world map with no direction on where to start.\nIn the end they can end up going through every city, just not in the “expected” order, or even travel through regions, changing leagues, skipping gyms, or even end up in a completely made up place.\nYou will notice this method will develop a much more organic adventure than trying to railroad a party through a map of cities, going from point A to point B each time an objective is “cleared”.\nThis is also beneficial for the Storyteller as you won’t have to prepare a grand set of chained events unfolding all through the region, but simply prepare the small sections the players will be exploring for the day.\n A Note on Breeding Pokémon When two Pokémon love each other very very much they’ll spend some time together and then a Pokémon Egg will appear. This is not just a tale that the adults tell children; no one really knows how these eggs pop into existence. It is one of the many mysteries in the world of Pokémon.\nBaby Pokémon need a lot of nurturing and love to grow happy and strong. All Pokémon can fall in love with each other, regardless of their species. The baby will often come out as the First-stage species of the mother.\nDue to parents not always being of the same species, Baby Pokémon may show traits that their species doesn’t normally have thanks to having a parent with a different set of powers.\nThis isn’t a game to get endless Pokémon eggs in search for the perfect offspring, should players get their hands on a Pokémon egg, remember to give it the importance it deserves, it’s not just time and heat what will make it hatch, it is through love and kindness that the baby Pokémon will come out.\nIt may take a few weeks or a few months but when the shell begins to crack it’ll be a big moment of happiness!\nBe ready to change diapers and bottle-feed your new bundle of joy.\n If you want to try out breeding Pokémon head to your nearest day-care center.\r A Note on Ecosystems What you just saw is only the first part of a great variety of creatures, how many of them you’ll end up seeing? It’s up to you!\nThis world has many ecosystems which you can fill with whatever number of creatures you want to bring it closer to life, with almost a thousand Pokémon to choose from.\nAdding variety to the creatures you encounter will increase the sense of wonder and discovery.\n Pokedex list see here.\n","description":"","id":30,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"寶可夢圖鑑","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/pokedex/"},{"content":"Frequently Asked Questions Can I Target an Ally with a Move that Targets a Foe? Yes, you can. Very rarely you’ll find a use to it, but sometimes it’s worth the effort, such as with Swagger or an Electric Move on a Pokémon with Volt Absorb.\nCan my Pokémon Target itself with a Move that Targets an Ally or a Foe? No, you can’t. Most Moves that target an Ally or a Foe are just impossible to be employed on the User, such as After You or Helping Hand, you need another target to benefit from this power. Now, if you’re talking about hitting your own Pokémon with its own attack, don’t expect your Pokemon to comply.\nWhat’s the meaning of “Out of Range”? Some moves like Fly or Dig take the Pokémon out of range of the fight. When a Pokémon is out of range, it is unaffected by attacks and Moves of any kind. As always, there may be exceptions depending on the situation.\nIf my Pokémon moves away during its turn, is it still in range of the foe? Yes. Fight’s are not static, people and Pokémon don’t stay rooted the whole scene exchanging blows until someone falls unconscious. Pokémon Battles are dynamic, everyone is constantly moving even if they’re not explicitly saying so. If you decide to run away, the Battle may end.\nMy Pokémon is able to float/fly is it still affected by Ground-Type Moves? If your Pokémon is not Flying-Type or harthe ability Levitate, or any other stated immunity to Ground, it will be affected.\nWhat’s the meaning of “Ready to Fight”? When a Pokémon switches in it cannot act until it stays Begining of the next Round.\nAt that time, the Pokémon is finally “Ready to Fight” and it can act normally.\nCan Protect/Detect/Wide Guard and the like stack with each other? No.\nSome Moves are labeled as “Switcher Moves” this allows the next Pokémon you send to switch in “Ready to Fight”.\nIf my Pokémon fainted, will my next Pokémon be “Ready to Fight”? Yes. When your Pokémon faints your turn is over. You may send your next Pokémon at the Beginning of the next Round and it will be Ready to Fight.\nIf my Pokémon moves away during its turn, is it still in range of the foe? Yes. Fight’s are not static, people and Pokémon don’t stay rooted the whole scene exchanging blows until someone falls unconscious. Pokémon Battles are dynamic, everyone is constantly moving even if they’re not explicitly saying so.\nI ordered my Pokémon to attack but the foe used a priority Move to attack me first, can I change the order into an Evasion? Yes. As long as your Pokémon wasn’t able to resolve its original action, you may order it to evade or even use another Priority Move.\nIs it possible to extend the duration of effects such as Rain Dance or Lucky Chant? Yes, at Storyteller’s discretion.\nCan I stack Attribute Increases on my Pokémon? Moves that increase the same Attribute won’t stack, but take the higher increase into account instead. They don’t stack with Items either, only with Abilities.\nCan I increase the Damage on Z-Moves, Max Moves and G-Max Moves? If you are of the appropiate Rank, you may. Take into account that each Damage Dice you increase will cost you an Effect.\nCan my Pokémon have Z-Moves, Max Moves and G-Max Moves at the same time? It is certainly possible, but it will be up to your Storyteller.\nIf I’m using Multiple Actions, how many successes do I need to Evade or Clash an attack? You just need to score as many successes as your foe, it doesn’t matter if it’s your first, second or fifth action. However, your next action WILL require an additional success, as Evading and Clashing do count as an Action.\nIs it possible to Evade more than once per Round? Only by using Double Team, Minimize or similar Moves.\nCan I use the Move Dig to escape from a building or a cave? Definetly. However, it may take some time depending on the terrain.\nUse common sense.\n","description":"","id":31,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"常見問題","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/pokemon-moves/faq/"},{"content":"Pokemon Abilities Along with their amazing powers, Pokémon are born with special Abilities that define their species. These Abilities may affect their personality and skill sets, and give them advantages in-and-out of battle.\nAlways consider the Ability of your Pokémon to aid you in any situation.\nSometimes Pokémon have more than one ability to choose from, outside of battle they can be used at will.\nAt the beginning of a battle, you must inform your storyteller which Ability your Pokemon will use.\nIt cannot be changed once the battle has started.\nWild Pokémon will always use the Ability that benefits them most in-battle, and the one that’s most useful for their survival out of it.\nEffects on Abilities do stack with effects on Moves, such as increasing or reducing attributes, but they rarely stack with each other, meaning that if two Pokémon have the same Ability only one will have effect.\nA Pokémon can make use of an Ability that is not listed on their Pokédex entry at storyteller’s discretion.\nRemember to check on important notes at the end of this section.\nForm-altering Abilities Certain Abilities will allow Pokémon to change between forms. When this happens it means only that Pokémon can make use of that Ability unless there is a convincing explanation as to how another Pokémon would alter their form to match the Ability’s effects.\nIt is convenient you have a character sheet for each of your Pokémon’s Forms.\nEach Form will have their Attribute points distriubted according to their rank but they do not necesarily have to match each other.\nIgnoring or Negating? When an Ability calls for Ignoring an effect, it means that only that Pokémon can act around the effect being ignored, but everything and everyone else will still be affected by it.\nWhen an Ability calls for negating an effect, it means thet the Pokémon who has their effects negated cannot access to their power due to external forces preventing it to do so.\nCurse Abilities Some effects of Moves or Abilities may require help from mediums to remove them. If such help is not available you can try to change it with another Move or Ability at your disposition. And if that doesn’t work, you can try to do it through sheer willpower or hoping the effects go away on their own after a few days\u0026hellip;\nThat can happen, right? right?!\nHidden Abilities Some Pokémon might have Abilities that are not listed on their Pokédex Entry.\nThese Hidden Abilities are the result of uncommon circumstances in a Pokémon’s life.\nIt’s up to the Storyteller to determine which Pokémon will obtain a certain Ability. Talk to him or her about how your Pokémon may obtain the Hidden Ability you want.\nKeep in mind that Pokémon with Abilities not usually seen on them are rare and will turn a few heads among Pokémon scholars.\n\nAbilities Lists see here.\n","description":"","id":32,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"寶可夢特性","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/pokemon-abilities/"},{"content":"Conclusion 10 Tips for Successful Battles 1. Train Your Pokémon. Through training you can try different builds of Attributes, Skills and Moves and find powerful combitations. If you want to be a strong Trainer you need strong Pokémon.\n2. Use your advantages. Not only Type advantages, consider what your Pokémon is good at and how you will exploit that in your favor.\n3. Use or create weaknesses. If the foe is too strong or fast, what will you use to counter it? Perhaps the foe is using a move with low Accuracy that can be evaded, and an attribute reduction will surely hinder its performance.\n4. Know your moves Learn the Power, Accuracy and effects of the moves you’ll be using regularly to get the most out of them.\n5. Evade, Clash and Cover Unless you are sure you’ll withstand the hit, evade, clash or take cover from attacks. Keep your damage intake per round as low as possible.\n6. Use Multiple Actions. Mastering multiple actions is a key to master Pokémon Battles. Bit by bit they help you gain an edge, increase your dice pools and get the most of them.\n7. Adapt to your opponent’s strategy. If you keep doing the same you’ll keep getting the same result. If something isn’t working, change your tactic or you\u0026rsquo;ll lose.\n8. Strike at the right time. Be patient, keep your cards in your hand. Don’t strike too early and risk to reveal them, don’t strike too late and miss your chance to do what you wanted.\n9. Be decisive Don’t make the battle drag on forever by taking too much time to decide what action you’ll take.\n10. Keep Trying. You and your Pokémon are a team, together you share victory and you share defeat. The road to success is built around failures.\nDon’t lose heart, and keep trying!\n As you can see, Pokémon battles are quite an exciting yet dangerous event.\nDon’t be disheartened if you lose a battle. Defeat is part of the road to success. Take one step at a time.\nAs a trainer, you’ll need to understand just how much you can ask from your Pokémon, and they will need your guidance to push their limits.\nThe secret to achieving a victory every time will be finding the right time to make your strikes.\nThere will be occasions in which you will need to endure a hit or two and you’ll have to choose which hits your Pokémon definitely needs to evade; other times you’ll have to risk everything in a single all-or-nothing attack. And when things can’t get any worse, you may need to spend some Will points and let fate decide.\nIt is a long way for a trainer to master all of the battle strategies, but having your friends beside you will make it a lot easier if you all learn from each other.\nIn any case, you’ll learn a lot more from experience, so go out there and live your own Pokémon battles!\nKeep the fights interesting by detailing the progression of the battle. Describe their actions and their effects, not only the damage spoints they take.\r ","description":"","id":33,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"總結","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/pokemon-battle/conclusion/"}]
