[{"content":"The Different Pokémon Types This world is filled with different sources of energy that Pokémon can control. They absorb it as part of their bod\u0002ies or shape it into powerful attacks.\nThe Pokémon that is especially proficient at using certain kind of energy is labeled with what we call a Type. Until now, 18 types of Pokemon have been recognized.\n\r\rNormal \rPokémon that are not especially proficient at controlling other energies. \r\rBug \rInsectoid creatures that get their strength out of a swarm-like mentality. \r\rDark \rPokémon that control the power of bad emotions and are known for commiting dishonorable actions. \r\rDragon \rCreatures of legend who use their inner rage to destroy anything that opposes them. \r\rElectric \rThey control electric currents. They feed and recharge out of lightning and thunder. \r\rFairy \rElusive and michievous creatures that bring both joy and tears to those who see them. \r\rFight \rThese Pokémon learned to use their body as a weapon. Some materialize their own energy into attacks. \r\rFire \rPokémon that resist heat, they produce and shape fire to burn anything on their wake. \r\rFlying \rThey control the wind currents and are masters of the sky, earth bound creatures cannot easily reach them. \r\rGhost \rBeings from the underworld. They are lurkers in the shadows who prey on the vital energy of the living. \r\rGrass \rPokémon with a plant-like appearance. They feed on sunlight. Some grow flowers and others grow thorns. \r\rGround \rThese Pokémon live below the ground. They can control the movement of earth and all of its properties. \r\rIce \rIce and snow froze their bodies. They can resist and create glacial temperatures. \r\rPoison \rThese creatures carry venom on their body. They bring sickness and plague wherever they go. \r\rPsychic \rThey feed on mental energy to use telekinesis. They are some of the most intelligent beings on the planet. \r\rRock \rTheir body is their armor, they create rock slides and crush their enemies beneath. \r\rSteel \rA cold steel plate covers their bodies. they behave like an organic machine. Ruthless and cold. \r\rWater \rAquatic creatures that can breath under water, they can call the rain and shoot mighty torrents. \r\rEach one of these types has different powers they can use. Some Pokémon are capable of using not just one but two types of energy, gaining the resistances and weaknesses of their second type as well.\nResistances, Weaknesses, \u0026amp; Immunities There are many ways to win during a battle; you either use your foe’s weaknesses against him or you exploit your own strengths. A good trainer chooses the right pokémon for the right occasion, in and out of Battle.\nPokémon Types are a common way to gain an edge in a fight. If you happen to choose a Pokémon that resists your foe’s attacks, it won’t be much of a problem if your companion isn’t as strong.\nThe Pokémon Types Chart can be seen here.\nResistances All Pokémon Types (with the exception of Normal Type) are able to resist certain Move Types.\nThis kind of protection makes the damage received Not very effective reducing 1 point from the total damage received.\nWeaknesses All Pokémon are weak to certain Move Types.\nThis vulnerability makes the damage taken Super Effective meaning the Pokémon will receive 1 additional point of damage from the attack but the roll MUST score at least 1 Success.\nImmunities A few Pokémon Types are Immune to other specific Types of damage. They will not receive any damage from attacks of that type, but may still be affected by support moves.\nDouble Resistance/Weakness Two types may share a resistance, this means that a double-type Pokémon may reduce up to 2 damage points from an attack that is Not very effective against both of its Types.\nThe same rule applies when receiving a Super Effective attack. If both of the Pokémon’s Types share a Weakness, the Pokémon will receive 2 additional damage.\nJosephine encountered a wild Ryhorn, she know’s this Pokémon is a Ground/Rock-type.\nShe has 3 Pokémon with her: Beedrill, a Bug/Poison-type; Slurpuff, a Fairy-type; and Lombre, a Grass/Water type.\nRyhorn has Ground and Rock-type attacks that are Super effective against Poison and Bug Pokémon, and it has a double resistance to Poison attacks. Beedrill would be a poor choice to fight it. Fairy type attacks of Slurpuff would be dealing neutral damage as Rhyhorn is not weak nor resistant to them. However, Rhyhorn is twice as weak to Water and Grass! Both Rock and Ground types share Water and Grass as weakness.\n- “Lombre! I choose you!”- Says Josephine\n ","description":"","id":0,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"不同的寶可夢屬性","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/pokemon-battle/pokemon-types/"},{"content":"介紹 歡迎來到Pokemon RPG！\n這是一本關於如何創造一個屬於你自己的故事，帶領你的角色以及寶可夢前往未知之旅的規則書！\n⬛ 什麼是角色扮演遊戲？ 角色扮演遊戲，就像是做為演員去演出一場戲劇。\n你可以試著在腦中想像一下和小朋友玩家家酒的畫面。你拿起一個代表你的玩偶，並且透過這個玩偶講話、跳躍、開車、進行各種傻里傻氣、或是令人驚豔的冒險。\n這也是同樣的道理。\n唯一不同的是，這個遊戲遵循著一些基本規則。依據這些規則，每個人都會知道自己可以做什麼，不能做什麼。然後在遊玩時，將會由一位說書人（Storyteller）來設計這個遊戲的過程及冒險。\n⬛ 說書人該做什麼事呢？ 直觀地從字面上來看，他或她將會擔當這個故事的述說者。說書人將會撰寫這場冒險、做出一些設定，並且將聚光燈照在玩家們身上。\n說書人將負責透過描述來賦予這個世界生命，並負責扮演NPC們，像是市民、反派角色、以及寶可夢。\n經常會有人誤解，認為說書人在遊戲故事中是宛如天神一般的存在，而玩家只是無力的棋子。但這並不正確，說書人這個身分其實更接近導演。\n他仍然必須使發生的事件合情合理，而且更重要的是，他有義務讓所有人都玩得開心。\n⬛ 寶可夢是什麼？ 寶可夢就像是我們世界中的動物。只不過牠們有著神奇的力量，且種類更跨越了植物和動物等物種。\n有些寶可夢是可以被馴養的、但也有一些太過野性且危險。儘管牠們大多都已經眾所周知，但牠們仍披著一層神秘且神奇的面紗，等待著我們發掘。\n⬛ 做為玩家，我該怎麼融入這個世界？ 在開始遊戲之前，你將會需要創造一個新的角色。\n這就像是創造一個你在這場冒險中的分身。他或她將會是任何你想要的樣貌：或高或矮、或聰明、或貴氣、或稚氣、或古怪。而最棒的是，你並不是獨自一人。你將在冒險中得到許多人的協助：你的朋友、你的寶可夢、和甚至成為朋友的NPC們。\n⬛ 如何使用這本書？ 這本書提供了許多規則，協助你創建故事、情境、角色、寶可夢，還有一些關於這個世界的基本資訊、以及如何展現它們的方式。\n然而，要記住只要你和你的玩家們覺得合適，你們就可以隨意補足這令人驚奇的寶可夢世界的任何設定，讓你和你的玩家能更加舒適地融入。\n在遊戲過程中最主要的工具，就是你的「想像力」。有了它，你們將能夠真正實現不可能之事：在藍天翱翔！從馳騁飛車上跳下！騎乘巨龍或甚至與幽靈交朋友！只要是你能想的到的，你就讓它在這個遊戲中化作真實。\n第二個你必須取得的工具是「角色卡」。玩家們將利用角色卡來記錄各自角色的數值和寶可夢搭檔。\n最後你必須使用的工具是「骰子」。只要有足夠的運氣，任何人都能創造奇蹟；反過來說，再頂尖的人也可能在倒楣的時候失族。\n你在遊戲中的命運，將會由你的能力數值以及一些些的骰運來決定。\n","description":"這個規則是什麼？這是一本關於如何創造一個屬於你自己的故事，帶領你的角色以及寶可夢前往未知之旅的規則書！","id":1,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"介紹","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/introduction/"},{"content":"創建角色 在《寶可夢扮演》這個遊戲中，你必須創建一名寶可夢訓練家（稱其為你的角色），這個人物將會是你在這個故事中的分身。\n你也將挑選一個起始寶可夢，跟你的角色一樣，這個選擇也相當重要。記住，你所選擇的寶可夢通常會反映出你身為訓練家的個性與志向。\n在創建角色時，儘管挑選那些玩起來有趣的內容，讓你能夠在遊戲中放飛做夢、犯蠢、並為你那些最瘋狂的點子盡情歡笑。或許你會想成為某部卡通裡的英雄、或以你崇拜的對象做為基礎來加筆、或甚至模仿某個著名的人物。\n此外，建議選擇那些你能夠輕易表現並演出的人格個性，因為你會需要經常將它扮演出來。\n記住，創造出一個有助於故事進行，而不是去傷害故事的角色。\n⬛ 訓練家概念 所謂的訓練家，就是擁有正式寶可夢訓練執照的人，但這個事實也只不過是你角色人生的冰山一角而已。想想你的角色會從事什麼工作或職業；他或她可能會是位醫生、漁夫、學校保全、一名初出茅廬的模特兒、或任何你覺得有趣的事物。給你的訓練家一個目標，並幫助他決定適合的個人特質。\n你和其他玩家需要決定你們將創造出什麼樣的角色，而這將會需要你、你的玩伴們、以及說書人之間的共同合作，讓玩家們能夠組成一個最好的團隊。\n和你的玩伴們一起完成你們的角色，並一起努力去實現你們訓練家的目標。\n⬛ 個人特質與背景 告訴大家一些有關於你訓練家的過往。\n你的訓練家可以是任何你想要他成為的人物，充實他或她的內在。不要讓他只是一具讓你在遊戲中施展手腳的空殼，而是一個懷抱著夢想和志向，有著缺陷和弱點，活生生的人物。\n為了創造一名豐滿且有說服力的角色，你可以詢問自己下列這些問題，並以你角色的視角來回答這些問題。\n 你的名字是什麼？ 你的年紀多大？ 你的「性格」是什麼？ （參見「性格」章節） 你的職業／角色概念是什麼？ 你對寶可夢世界有什麼樣的期望？  以及最重要的：\n你在寶可夢世界中有什麼樣的目標？ 你達成這個目標的動機是什麼？ 你會如何使這個世界變得更好？  回答這些問題能讓說書人更容易地為你的角色提供他或她所需要的挑戰。不要忘記，玩家們與說書人之間的良好溝通將能使這個故事更圓滑順暢地進行。\n玩家必須要回答完這些問題才能夠開始遊戲。\r 填寫訓練家角色卡 當你訓練家的角色概念準備就緒，你就可以接著分配角色的特質點數和技能點數。\n訓練家的所有特質起始皆為 1 點。\n新角色通常會以「新手」階級的青少年的身分來開始遊戲。更多關於階級的相關說明，請參照「階級」章節。\n特質 青少年有 2 點可以進行分配在特質上。\n你可能會因為你的起始階級不同而有額外可分配的點數。\n 力量: ●●○○○ 活力: ●○○○○ 靈巧: ●●○○○ 洞察: ●○○○○  社交特質 青少年有 2 點可以進行分配在社交特質上。\n你可能會因為你的起始階級不同而有額外可分配的點數。\n 強壯: ●○○○○ 美麗: ●●○○○ 帥氣: ●○○○○ 可愛: ●○○○○ 聰明: ●●○○○  技能 你有 5 點可以分配在技能上，新手的技能上限為 1 點。\n你可能會因為你的起始階級不同而有額外可分配的點數。\n 鬥毆: ○○○○○ 投擲: ○○○○○ 閃避: ●○○○○ 武器: ○○○○○   警覺: ●○○○○ 運動: ○○○○○ 自然: ●○○○○ 隱匿: ○○○○○   共感: ●○○○○ 禮儀: ○○○○○ 威嚇: ○○○○○ 表演: ○○○○○   工藝: ●○○○○ 傳聞: ○○○○○ 醫藥: ○○○○○ 科學: ○○○○○   ⬛ 我不是新手！ 有一些故事會更適合年齡較大、經驗更豐富、更擅長處理事情的訓練家。如果你想要扮演年紀更大或階級更高的角色，那麼你可以遵循下列的簡單指南：\n\r\r階級\r額外特質點\r額外社交點\r技能點\r技能上限\r\r新手  0  0  5  1 \r初學者  2  2  +4  2 \r業餘者  4  4  +3  3 \r菁英  6  6  +2  4 \r專家  8  8  +1  5 \r\r你必須先把你前個階級獲得的所有技能點給分配完畢，才能接著分配下個階級的所有技能點。單個技能累積分配的點數不能超過技能上限。\n年紀也是一個你必須考慮的因素。就算你的年紀足以獲得訓練家執照，並不代表你能夠在沒有監督的情況下環遊世界。\n訓練家角色的年紀可以比青少年更小／更大，並因此在開始遊戲時獲得更少／更多的特質和社交特質點數。\n\r\r年紀\r特質／社交點\r\r兒童  0/0 \r青少年*  2/2 \r成年人  4/4 \r年長者  3/6 \r\r*新遊戲的基本起始年紀。\n訓練家角色卡 如何填寫訓練家角色卡:\n訓練家卡片區塊 \r  你的角色圖像。 你的訓練家階級。 你角色的名稱。 你角色的年紀。 你的名字。 你角色的角色概念。 選擇一個「性格」，並寫下相應的信心值。 起始金錢為 $1500。 每一點活力都會增加 1 點 HP。 意志點。它的數值等同於 洞察 + 2。 現役隊伍欄位。寫下你目前攜帶的寶可夢們。  特質＆技能區塊 \r 特質。起始為 1。 你的年紀跟階級將決定你可以分配的點數。 技能。你的階級將決定你可以分配的點數以及技能上限。 社交特質。起始為 1。你的年紀跟階級將決定你可以分配的點數。 成就。 寫下你需要達成什麼成就來提高你的階級。 寶可夢圖鑑資訊。寫下你目前收服和見過的寶可夢數量。  背包區塊 \r 藥水袋。 列出你攜帶了多少瓶藥水、以及瓶子內還有多少份藥水。 置物口袋。 放在這裡的道具可以在戰鬥中被使用。 主袋。 放在這裡的道具不能在戰鬥中被使用。 道館徽章盒。  ","description":"說明如何創建訓練家角色","id":2,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"創建角色","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/starting-the-game/create-character/"},{"content":"Pokemon Moves It’s more important to master the cards you’re holding than to complain about the ones your opponents were dealt.\r-Grimsley\r\rPokémon inhabit the vast majority of this world and they protect themselves using wondrous powers. They are able to call upon a certain kind of energy and shape it to attack foes or weaken them; some Pokémon can even use their powers to strengthen or heal themselves and others.\nThese powers are known as Moves.\nAll Pokémon have a hidden greatness that lies dormant. Especially your companions.\nIn the wild, Pokémon will learn new Moves as they grow in age or experience, however, a skilled Trainer will be able to bring out the max potential of any Pokémon.\nRemember, your Pokémon are a reflection of you as a Trainer, the Rank you are in will unlock more Moves for your companions.\nJust like Pokémon, there are 18 Types of Moves.\nEach Type has a unique way of fighting and solving their problems. The most powerful trainers find a Type that matches their way of thinking and facing challenges as a means to be in synch with their Pokémon and have an easier time to bond with them.\nAll Move descriptions were written by the League and explain their use in Battle. However, Moves are originally used for survival and convenience; even attacking Moves. Through these powers your Pokémon shapes its world and so should you, because Battle is just an aspect of what it means to be a Trainer.\nFind creative uses for your Pokémon Moves.\nBasic Rules for Moves  Pokémon may only learn moves from their Rank or lower. Unless they Overank p. 73 The limit to the amount of Moves a Pokémon is able to learn is equal to its Insight Score + 2. During a Training Session a Move can be replaced by another one the Pokémon is able to learn. An Evolved Pokémon can’t learn a Move exclusive to a previous stage, but it may keep it if it got that Move before evolving.   Rules for Moves during Battle  Moves can only be used during the Pokémon’s Turn and during a Clash. A Move can be used only ONCE each round. (Clashing counts as using the Move) Moves that use a Social Attribute (Cool, Cute, Tough, Smart, Beauty) for Accuracy can’t be evaded or clashed. Moves with “All Foes in Range” and “User and Allies in Range” affect a number of targets specified in your Rank. p. 30 Who’s hit by an Area Move is decided by the Storyteller. You may hit your Allies!   Reading a Moves All Moves are presented with graphical elements and text. They are divided in 9 sections.\n\r  Name of the Move Power - Number of Dice added to the Damage Roll. Category Icon - Physical, Special or Support. Type - See The Different Pokémon Types on p.42 Accuracy - Traits used to perform this Move. Damage Pool - Attribute + Power + Modifiers. Additional Info - Most Moves have unique effects. Effect Icons - They are a quick reference as to what the Move does in battle. Move Descriptions - It will tell you what you need to know about using this Move inside or outside a Battle.  Typeless Maneuvers Not every attack is a Move. Sometimes you will fight with simple Typeless Maneuvers.\nSince they don’t use energy, Typeless Maneuvers can’t be used to clash, but other than that they share the same rules as Moves whe used in-battle:\n Maneuvers can only be used on the user’s Turn. Can only be used once per Round.  Battle Maneuvers can be used for attacking or defending, and they also have a lot of use outside of battle. Since anyone can perform them, Humans and Pokémon, they can enrich your strategy.

If the user is Blocked this Maneuver fails.\r\r\rTechnical Machines (Optional) If you’re lucky you can find/buy discs containing guides to teach any Move to a Pokémon called Technical Machines or TM’s for short. Whoever wrote these guides is an incredible Pokémon expert that will give you great tips to get almost any move you want on your Pokémon, it’s not for cheap, though, TM’s prices range from $1000 to $5000.\nWhich Move is contained inside the disc and which Pokémon may learn from it is up to the Storyteller. Teaching a Move by TM must be done on a Training Session.\nPokémon can learn a variety of TM’s, some of the Moves in them will be a different Type than the Pokémon being taught.\r Miscellaneous ⬛ Fling/Natural Gift This Move’s Type and Power can vary wildly.\nPower Foul Berries aren’t very strong, but delicious Berries are quite powerful. Power ranges from 0 to 3.\nFlavor - Type  Spicy - Fire Juicy - Water Fresh - Grass Sour - Electric Oily - Fighting Frozen - Ice Rotten - Poison Dry - Ground Effervescent - Flying Numbing - Psychic Half eaten - Bug Tough - Rock Withered - Ghost Uneatable - Dragon Bitter - Dark Salty - Steel Sugary - Fairy  ⬛ Secret Power/Nature Power The Pokémon absorbs and redirects the properties of its environment onto the target. In the case of Nature Power, the move also changes type accordingly at storyteller’s discretion.\n  Close to a Building:\nRedirect the electric current to inflict Paralysis.\n  Close to a Cave:\nRedirect the rubble to hit and Flinch the foe.\n  Close to a Desert or Road:\nRediret the dust on the terrain to Reduce 1 success from the Accuracy rolls of the target.\n  Close to Grass:\nRedirect the bug and grass powder left in the terrain to inflict Sleep.\n  Close to Snow:\nRedirect the cold wind to Freeze the Foe.\n  Close to Water:\nRedirect a pool of water to engulf the foe, reducing 1 point to their Strength as it tries to fight underwater.\n  ⬛ Relationship between Attributes and Moves As you probably noticed, the effectiveness of some Moves is greatly influenced by your Attributes. Some of them allow you to run faster, such as Quick Attack or Extreme Speed, while others require you to lift certain weight, such as Sky Drop or Rock Throw. But just how fast or how strong is your Pokémon?\nThe following charts describe the maximum Lifting Capacity and maximum Speed for humans and most Pokémon. Please note that some species may lift more or less weight, or move faster or slower. As always the Storyteller has the final word on this topic.\nStrength Chart (Lifting Capacity)  Each point in the Athletic Skill adds 8 lb / 4 kg to the Lifting Capacity. Lifting Capacity is affected by Pain Penalizations.  \r●○○○○ ○○○○○40 lb/18 kg\r●●○○○ ○○○○○100 lb/45 kg\r●●●○○ ○○○○○250 lb/113 kg\r●●●●○ ○○○○○400 lb/181 kg\r●●●●● ○○○○○650 lb/294 kg\r●●●●● ●○○○○800 lb/362 kg\r●●●●● ●●○○○900 lb/408 kg\r●●●●● ●●●○○1000 lb/453 kg\r●●●●● ●●●●○1200 lb/544 kg\r●●●●● ●●●●●1500 lb/680 kg\r\rDexterity Chart (Maximum Speed)  Each point in the Athletic Skill adds 1.4 mi / 2km per hour to the Maximum Speed. Pain Penalizations reduce your Speed:  At Half HP you can only walk; At 1 HP remaining, you can only crawl.   Lifting someone or something halves your Speed, unless you can lift twice the weight of what you’re carrying.  \r●○○○○ ○○○○○6 mph/10 kmph\r●●○○○ ○○○○○12 mph/20 kmph\r●●●○○ ○○○○○15 mph/25 kmph\r●●●●○ ○○○○○18 mph/30 kmph\r●●●●● ○○○○○24 mph/40 kmph\r●●●●● ●○○○○31 mph/60 kmph\r●●●●● ●●○○○49 mph/80 kmph\r●●●●● ●●●○○62 mph/100 kmph\r●●●●● ●●●●○80 mph/130 kmph\r●●●●● ●●●●●99 mph/160 kmph\r\r","description":"","id":3,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"招式的規則","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/pokemon-moves/basic-rules/"},{"content":"Pokemon Contest Pokémon Trainers usually make Pokémon Battles their main focus and it’s all right if you like that kind of crude and violent entertainment, but why would you want to be exchanging blows like a brute when you can follow a lifestyle of luxury and riches thanks to Pokémon Contests?\nWhat are Pokémon Contests? When you talk about Pokémon Contests, you talk about the most profitable show business in this world. These major events take many forms, from Beauty Pageants, to Science Fairs, Staged Battles, Music Festivals, or most commonly, the All-in-one show for everyone to mesmerize at the talent and grace of Trainers and their Pokémon companions.\nThey are pretty much like a talent show; You present yourself and your Pokémon before an Audience and the Judges to see if your presentation meets all the required criteria; if it does, you win! Sounds easy, right? No Damage, Critical Hits, or Fainting standing between you and that awesome First-Place Ribbon. But wait! Just because no one faints at the end of these shows doesn’t mean the competition isn’t fierce but rather the opposite, top tier Contests are full of highly competitive Trainers.\nPeople fall apart under the spotlight. Criticism is fierce, Judges can be ruthless and even the audience can be a tough nut to crack.\nThese are not battles of power, you will use all of your social skills to confidently advance the rounds and earn the admiration of your peers and the good graces of the judges.\nIn a Pokémon Contest you are trying your best to show that you and your Pokémon have the talent, charisma and expertise to give a performance that will astound the world.\nConfidence and Stress To present yourself before an audience you need to be confident enough to handle the stress that comes from having to entertain hundreds if not thousands of people.\nNatures give a specific amount of Confidence Points (p. 38) You may think of Confidence as a “Social HP” that will help you keep your cool under pressure.\nLosing Confidece is similar to losing HP, but instead of suffering damage to your body, you’ll suffer stress and emotional damage. You’ll get progressively nervous and anxious, then histerical. Some will crumble under the pressure of being before an audience and if the stress gets too heavy you may completely shut down, explode into tears or go into an angry rampage. That is what we call a Breakdown.\nAny Contestant, Trainer or Pokémon, who suffers a Breakdown on stage, will be automatically disqualified. \rConfidenceEmotional StateStress Penalization\r\rFull Confidence \rPositive \rNone. You can do this! \r\rHalf Confidence(Rounded down) \rNervous \rAllies nearby will lose 1 Confidence Point each Round. \r\r1 remaining Confidence Point \rFreaking out \rRoll every action twice, keep the lowest roll. \r\rZero Confidence \rBreakdown \rAll Social Rolls fail automatically. \r\rStress Penalizations stack on each other and can only be removed through Trick cards or by spending time relaxing.

Once the order is established, it will stay that way until the end of the fight.\nPokémon may use priority Moves to temporarily change the initiative order, or moves that strategically make others go last.\nRound A Round is a period about 10 seconds long, within that timeframe the Pokémon and Trainers perform their actions and attacks. It is composed of Turns.\nIf a Pokémon is fast and experienced it may only need a few seconds to perform many attacks in the same Round. A low rank Pokémon might need the whole Round to perform only one attack.\nTurns A Turn is a fraction of the Round when a Pokémon uses its action to perform a Move.\nEnd of the Round Once all Pokémon have performed their respective actions and everything has been resolved, the Round ends.\nTrainers have a chance to perform an action in this stage.\nSome Moves and Status Conditions have effects at this point in the fight.\nBattling Step by Step Step 1: Initiative - “Pikachu, I choose you!” -\rRoll 1 Die and add yout Initiavive score to the result.\rYour Initiative Score is equal to:\nDexterity + Alert\rWhoever gets the higher result may act first, whoever got the second best result goes second and so on.\nStep 2: Use a Move  - “Pikachu, use Thunderbolt!” -\rRoll the Move’s Accuracy.\rDuring your Pokémon’s Turn you may order it to use a Move.\nOnce you have selected the Move, Roll the dice for Accuracy to see if the move hits or misses.\nEach Move has its required Accuracy roll on its entry.\nStep 2.5: Evasion/Clash (Optional) - \"Eevee, don't let it hit you!\" -\rThe foe might try to evade or retaliate.\nThe foe Rolls Dexterity + Evasion\rIf the foe scores as many successes as you, he evades the attack and won\u0026rsquo;t receive any damage or effects.\nOR\nThe foe Rolls Strength/Special + Clash\rIf the foe scores as many successes as you, he Clashes the attack and both Pokémon will suffer 1 point of Damage instead of the regular damage from the attack. Weaknesses and Resistances are taken into account when clashing.\n Evading and Clashing takes one Action. Clash also requires the use of a Damaging Move. Evasion/Clash can be used only once per Round, each.  Step 3: Damage Roll the Move’s Damage minus the foe’s DEF/SDEF.\rIf the Move landed, it\u0026rsquo;s time to gather the Dice pool to deal damage. Each Move\u0026rsquo;s entry has its Damage pool list\u0002ed, and they are usually:\nStrength/Special + Move's Power - Foe's DEF/SDEF\rEach success on your Damage Roll inflicts 1 point of damage\nA successfully landed attack always deals 1 point of Damage even if your Damage Pool is reduced to 0 or you score No Successes on the Damage Roll.\nIf you want to apply the bonus damage from Super Effective, you must score at least 1 success on your Damage Roll.\n Step 4: Next! - “Eevee, Sand-Attack, now!” -\rThe next Pokémon will have their Turn.\rThe next Pokémon in the Initiative order will now have a chance to use a Move.\nNow\u0026rsquo;s the turn for another Pokémon to follow the Steps 2 and 3.\nStep 5: Multiple Actions. A Pokémon may have more Turns on the same Round\rAfter all Pokémon have had their action from the first to the last, any Pokémon can try to use another Move during the same Round. For more information on how Multiple Actions work, head to p.49\nThe order on which everyone takes these extra Turns is the same as their original order of initiatives.\nEnd of the Round. The Round ends, time to start over.\rAfter everyone has exhausted all of their actions, all that’s left is to wrap everything up and start over until a victor is declared.\nTrainers have a chance to perform an action and some Moves, Status Ailments, and other agents have effects at this point of the battle.\nTrainer Actions Trainers are not only spectators of a battle, and at the end of each round, they have a brief chance to make one action.\nChoose between these different Actions, each one with its own set of pros and cons.\n Switching Pokémon. Use an Item on a Pokémon. Search for cover. Enter the fray. Run Away from Battle.  ⬛ Switching Pokémon Trainers can spend their action to send out and recall up to two Pokémon. It is possible to Recall your Pokémon at any point during the Round, but During Official matches you must immediatley Send Out another Pokémon or else you are conceding defeat.\nIf a Pokémon is switched in the middle of the Round, it will be startled and disoriented as it is coming out from a safe environment within the Pokéball and into a chaotic battlefield.\nIt will stay looking at its surroundings and may become the target of an attack.\nFor a Switched Pokémon to get out of this dazed state it will need a few seconds to digest all that is happening, this means the Pokémon will not be able to attack or evade until the beginning of the next round.\nSwitch your Pokémon at the end of the round to avoid this.\n ⬛ Use an Item on a Pokémon Pokémon may get hurt during a fight but Trainers can\u0026rsquo;t get in the middle of the battle and risk injury to aid their Pokémon.\nThe Trainer will call their Pokémon to come closer and quickly give them treatment by rolling:\nClever + Medicine\rHowever, this will make the Pokémon vulnerable for a few seconds as it won\u0026rsquo;t be able to Attack, Evade or use Moves of any kind while you apply the medicine.\nThe battle continues and using an Item on your Pokémon requires it to be still for a whole Round!\nIf your Trainer enters the Fray, you can apply medicine without having to stop your Pokémon from battling.\n⬛ Search for Cover Non-official battles are chaotic, and Trainers can be in the danger zone where all the attacks are landing. At the End of the Round a Trainer can roll:\nInsight + Alert\rTo quickly scan their surroundings and get behind cover, this will ensure their safety for as long as the cover resists.\n⬛ Enter the Fray They say that if you want something done right you have to do it yourself, and some Trainers take it to heart.\nAt the End of the Round, your Trainer can choose to be an active part of the battle, on next round he or she will roll their initiative and have a turn alongside everyone else.\nA Trainer in the fray is focused on fighting, you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to give orders to your Pokémon, leaving them without direction and only with their Natures as a guide on what actions thay will take.\nSwitching Pokémon and Search for Cover won\u0026rsquo;t be possible either, for these actions require complete focus.\nBeing directly in the battle risks Trainers to grave injury.\nThe League banned this kind of behavior on Official Matches.\nAt the end of the Round, the Trainer can choose to go back to command their Pokémon.\n⬛ Run Away from Battle You are not forced to keep battling until all your Pokémon collapse and you black out. In Official Matches you can simply concede defeat to end the battle, for non-official battles it gets a bit trickier.\nYour Trainer can recall their Pokémon at the End of the Round and make a run for it, rolling:\nDexterity + Athletic VS the Foe's Dexterity + Athletic\rIf you score more successes than your foe, the battle ends. Being Blocked prevents you from escaping.\n","description":"","id":6,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"如何戰鬥","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/pokemon-battle/how-to-battle/"},{"content":"Effect Icons There are many Icons in this Move Encyclopedia.

在這世界中生活的人們與你我無異。他們有家庭和朋友，也同樣追求著財富、愛情、名聲、和平以及刺激。\n然而，他們的世界與我們有許多不同：其中，寶可夢的存在幾乎改變了所有事物。\n在這個世界裡，許多人遊走旅行在各個地區，尋求著冒險、神祕，以及成為頂尖的機會。\n城市的數量較為稀少且相距甚遠，但小型的城鎮倒是相當常見。他們某方面的科技相當進步，但也有些方面看起來已經過時。\n如果你想要冒險前往其他地區，你將會需要寶可夢來保護你遠離各種旅途上的危險。\n為了讓你更容易理解寶可夢世界中的危險，讓我們換一個觀點來看：\n鱷魚是種很危險的生物，對吧？\n那麼，試著想像有一隻鱷魚，牠的速度迅捷如獵豹，還能從口中射出光束、眼睛發出閃光！\n如果這樣對你來說還不夠危險，那麼就準備好跳上那無法控制的命運列車軌道吧！你所採取的每一步，以及每一個在你旅途中出現的生物，都有著他自己的故事。\n僅僅是離開城鎮幾哩之遙都有可能導致無數麻煩，但也可能會讓你經歷世界上最令人興奮的故事。\n但等等！這個遊戲並不只是你而已，而是你和你的寵物！\n你是否曾經覺得你的狗狗想要保護你遠離某些東西？ 像是，就算一切都亂了套而危險逐步靠近的時候，你總會有個小小守護者在你身邊，保護你平安歸家。這就是這個遊戲的精髓。 一場你、你忠誠的狗狗、伶俐的貓咪、以及傻氣的鳥兒共同交織的，令人雀躍的旅途。\n口袋怪獸 生活在這個世界的生物都有著不可思議的力量。牠們形體各異，大小不同，且從創世以來就棲息在這個世界上。牠們有些早已絕種，而有些則是在近代才被發現。\n在人類出現之初，這些生物中最古老而強大的個體們統治著這個世界。一開始，人類畏懼牠們。然而在數個世紀之後，人類和這些生物如今共同生活在一起，互相建立起了信任及忠誠的羈絆。\n人們學會了如何將這些生物安全地存放在一個口袋大小的裝置中，並能在需要的時候將其放出。這項技術帶給了這些神祕生物牠們現在的名字：「口袋怪獸」，簡稱「寶可夢」。\n而這也正是宣告了這革命性概念的開始。\n現在，人們能收服這些生物，安全地與牠們互動，並利用牠們特殊的能力來改變這個世界。透過這股力量，許多人出發展開了偉大的冒險，嘗試收服所有的寶可夢。\n儘管如此，寶可夢的世界仍然屬於寶可夢，且其大部分的奧秘也尚未被解開。\n⬛ 寶可夢的進化 寶可夢有著特別的神奇力量，牠們能透過一種快速且戲劇性的變化，來變得更大、更快且更強壯。\n這些現象被稱為「進化」，且大部分的寶可夢都能夠發生這樣的現象。\n這個變化的發生有許多種不同的原因，最常見的情形是寶可夢成長到了足以讓他進化的階段。\n除此之外，接觸不同種類的能量、細心地呵護、身體的鍛鍊、或是嚴峻的環境都可能是寶可夢進化的契機。\n也有一些報告指出，即使有些寶可夢的物種是能夠進化的，但仍有個體終其一生都不會經歷這樣的變化。關於這個現象的研究仍然有很長一段路要走。\n值得注意的是，許多寶可夢的行為舉止在進化之後也會跟著改變。\n有些寶可夢會在獲得更強的力量之後變得叛逆或重拾野性；也有些會變得更認真、更大膽、或更狂暴。只有最熟練的專家才能夠駕馭完全進化的寶可夢。\n寶可夢世界中的生活 人們對這個世界的起源有著許多不同的理論和傳說。儘管沒有任何一個能被證實，但一個不可否認的事實是：寶可夢從一開始就已經存在。\n牠們在史前時代自在遊蕩，棲居於陸地、海洋與天空，爭奪著食物與領土。現今發現的化石描繪出了那人類還未出現的遙遠過去，為我們展現著那些已經滅絕的寶可夢、以及牠們的生活方式。\n當第一批人類開始定居時，那些較為溫和的物種來到他們的身邊尋求庇護，並建立了一種基於共同生存意志的緊密、互惠的羈絆。\n而這種羈絆就這麼一直延續到了今日。\n由於廣泛使用了高科技裝置以及古老的替代品，現代寶可夢世界看起來或許有些矛盾。\n然而首先要記得，這並不是人類的世界。與寶可夢相比，人類是如此稀少且孱弱，以至於無法真正成為這個世界的優勢物種。其次，人類所有的科學和技術成就全都是倚靠寶可夢的協助而發展起來的。\n這個世界的人們並未發現如何生起火焰，也沒有駕馭發電的方式。他們只是單純借助火系和電系寶可夢的幫助。\n這就是為什麼這個世界的某些科技能有飛躍性的發展，但整體社會卻沒有足夠都市化的原因。\n人們享受著簡單的生活，因為他們只需要從大自然獲取所需，而不需要承擔太多的風險。\n他們不需要太多的奢侈品、假期、複雜的經濟體系、或是強大的執法機關。\n然而，人們確實發展出了卓越的醫療系統以及豐富的醫療知識。能夠治療傷口和疾病的「靈丹妙藥」比比皆是。\n雖然這樣的治療技術似乎很常見，但沒有人真的知道這些藥物是從何而來，也沒有人知道這些常用的技術究竟是誰發明的。\n⬛ 人們與寶可夢之間的互動 在近代，人類居住區與寶可夢之間的分界可謂非常薄弱，但即使生活圈如此接近，大多數人類還是會選擇把自己安全地隔離在城鎮和城市裡頭，只讓少數無害的寶可夢在裡頭游蕩。\n世界上那些最為狂野的寶可夢往往隱居在遠離人煙的地方。如果有人膽敢侵入，野生寶可夢將會極力捍衛牠們的領土。也因此，人們往往傾向讓已經馴化或是由人類養大的寶可夢待在身邊，讓自己能過上更輕鬆的生活。\n你在城鎮中所見到的寶可夢通常被用來保護人們、或是協助各式各樣的工作，其他有些則是作為家庭寵物，而也有些寶可夢會被那些最為邪惡的惡黨當作武器來使用。\n投身於捕捉、馴服、和教導這些生物如何與人類共同生活的人們，被稱為寶可夢訓練家。\n寶可夢訓練家的生態與於職業運動員有些相似。他們最主要的活動被稱為「寶可夢對戰」，主要目標在於利用寶可夢自身強大的能力與技能擊敗對方的寶可夢。\n為了規範與約束這個職業，寶可夢聯盟 成立了。\n主要地區 就像我們的世界一樣，寶可夢世界劃分了許多不同的地區，且每個地區就是一個完整的國家。然而，這些國家並不是以實際的陸地或海洋做為分界，而是按照寶可夢聯盟來劃分的。\n不過還是有例外存在：關都地區與城都地區被湊在了一塊，並共享著一部份的寶可夢聯盟賽制。除此之外的其他地區都有著自己的聯盟挑戰賽、寶可夢品種、著名訓練家、和其他獨特事物。\n能在某個區域被輕易找到的寶可夢，在其他地區也許就罕見。這也是為什麼寶可夢訓練家很多都是環遊世界的旅行者，他們前往不同的地區四處探險，尋找是否有不一樣的寶可夢存在。\n\r ⬛ 關都地區 Kanto 關都地區 與現代日本相當類似。這裡是科技的搖籃，也是世界知名的西爾佛（Silph）公司總部和寶可夢聯盟的誕生地。\n在這個地區，寶可夢戰鬥不只是一種全國性的運動，更是他們的生活方式。\n關都寶可夢聯盟的組織非常龐大，因此也負責了城都地區的聯盟賽註冊事宜。這是一個充滿強大訓練家、豐富多彩的地區。\n⬛ 城都地區 Johto 城都地區與關都地區相鄰。這是一個古老的地區，城鎮稀少分散，而且大城市很少。\n城都地區充滿了許多神廟和傳說。儘管這裡的生活古樸，但他是個相當和平且適合居住的地方。這裡同時也是 阿露福遺跡（the Ruin\u0026rsquo;s of Alph）的所在地：一座少有人膽敢深入探索的神秘城市遺跡。\n⬛ 豐緣地區 Hoenn 這是一個彼此關係豐沛而密切的地區。人們與自然和平相處，且人類與各種寶可夢都能和睦共存。豐緣地區由許多島嶼組成，而這些島嶼了提供豐富多樣的自然環境。\n據說有許多奇景隱藏在深海之中，以及煙囪山的中心。\n⬛ 神奧地區 Sinnoh 傳說神奧是第一個被眾神創造的地區，或許這也正是這裡帶有神秘與雄偉氛圍的原因。\n神奧地區是著名的冠軍「竹蘭」的出生地，這名女性深入探索著傳說領域，尋找著關於這個世界起源的真相。據說在這個地區的某處存在著通往另一個恐怖世界的傳送門。\n⬛ 合眾地區 Unova 遠離所有其他地區，合眾地區保有一些世界上最奇異特別的寶可夢。這是一個壯觀宏偉的地區，有著現代化的大城市以及優秀的交通系統：火車以及機場，這在其他的地區非常罕見。\n然而要多加留意，這個地區偶爾會傳出有奇怪的寶可夢引發各種自然災害的消息。\n⬛ 卡洛斯地區 Kalos 卡洛斯是一個發達的工業地區，富有是這裡的代名詞。這個地區的人們已經發展出了一個有著現代化環境與高生活品質的國家。\n卡洛斯地區同時也是地理範圍最大的一個地區，許許多多的人們和寶可夢居住於此。密阿雷市是你必去的著名旅遊景點之一：一座被金黃鵝卵石覆蓋的美麗都市，還有一座高聳的棱柱塔矗立在城市的中心點。\n⬛ 阿羅拉地區 Alola 這個地區是由數個小型島嶼群組成，且直到最近才成立了自己的寶可夢聯盟。這些天堂般的島嶼富含令人驚豔的旅遊景點和當地文化。這裡有著相當豐富的文化與傳說，居民們看待寶可夢們的方式也更接近魔法生物。這同時體現在了他們對聯盟挑戰的態度、以及他們與島嶼上關於「守護神寶可夢」傳說和神話之間的特殊聯繫上。\n⬛ 伽勒爾地區 Galar 伽勒爾地區的人民為他們的歷史與文化而自豪：他們的戰士、騎士和國王在古代戰爭中團結一致並取得了勝利。而他們的遺志至今依然存在於伽勒爾人那無與倫比的戰鬥精神和競爭力之中。\n寶可夢聯盟就是這裡的一切，聯盟賽的每一場戰鬥都是一場盛大的體育賽事，在賽場中到處都是粉絲、觀眾、贊助商、和營銷人員。在伽勒爾，寶可夢戰鬥能夠帶來相當巨大的利益。\n寶可夢聯盟 寶可夢聯盟是一個規範人們與寶可夢之間互動關係的組織，他們負責發放許可持有和指揮寶可夢的執照。寶可夢聯盟是這個世界最高的權威組織，且他們旗下的訓練家和飼育員提供寶可夢們以協助建造一個繁榮和平的世界。\n在寶可夢聯盟存在以前，對於那些濫用寶可夢以傷害他人、或為自己私利謀取權力的壞人，人們並沒有任何規則或法律可以用來保護自己。寶可夢之間的對戰有可能變得相當危險，因此，寶可夢聯盟組織被創立，以求在這個混亂的情境中建立起秩序。\n在地區中成立寶可夢聯盟能帶來許多好處，該地區的居民將能夠在寶可夢訓練家的幫助下得到寶可夢的協助，他們也能期待聯盟透過寶可夢中心為城鎮提供現代化的醫療保健設施。\n寶可夢聯盟同時也提供了像是道館挑戰賽和年度錦標賽等賽事讓所有訓練家挑戰，來自該地區各處的人們將聚集在賽場，觀賞著訓練家們、四天王、和冠軍彼此之間激盪出最精彩的高水準戰鬥。\n寶可夢聯盟 訓練家守則 基本守則  你必須擁有寶可夢聯盟的執照，才能訓練寶可夢或是參加任何由聯盟舉辦的挑戰賽及競賽。 你必須對自己寶可夢的行為負責。 任何寶可夢都有權利開開心心的。 你不能擁有沒被精靈球收服的寶可夢。 你最多只能隨身攜帶六隻寶可夢。 你只能使用聯盟官方的寶可夢交換機器來進行寶可夢的交換。  對戰守則  你只能挑戰其他擁有執照的訓練家。 如果你受到進行官方聯盟對戰的挑戰，則你有義務接受挑戰。 你可以利用寶可夢對戰做為解決爭議的手段，輸家必須要讓步至少24小時。 你有權挑戰道館館主，且每個道館館主都有義務接受你的挑戰。 由挑戰者先行選擇出戰的寶可夢。唯一的例外是道館館主和四天王，他們永遠必須先行選擇出戰的寶可夢。 你不能在對戰中同時使用超過一隻的寶可夢。雙打對戰是例外，在雙打對戰中你不能同時使用超過兩隻的寶可夢。 你不能在正式寶可夢對戰中使用藥品，除非所有參與對戰的訓練家都已經在事先達成協議。 嚴禁在任何類型的寶可夢對戰中讓你的寶可夢持用任何非官方的武器或物品。 嚴禁以全力施放可能會導致寶可夢死亡的招式。 嚴禁更改招式的正式名稱。 嚴禁給出混淆的指令來欺騙你的對手。 嚴禁在正式對戰中打斷或攻擊訓練家。  福利  任何透過讓其寶可夢為社會服務或推廣寶可夢訓練家良好形象來幫助社群的訓練家，寶可夢聯盟都將給予表彰。 正式寶可夢對戰永遠會根據訓練家之間的事前協議以獎金方式獎勵贏家。若沒有事前協議，則獎金為輸家身上一半的金錢。 你有權利免費使用任何寶可夢聯盟的設施。  懲處 違反任何寶可夢聯盟所訂定的規則，無論是否故意，都會遭到寶可夢聯盟當局的懲處。\n 根據違規行為，懲處可能會從最輕 5,000 元罰金和社區服務，到最嚴重吊銷或撤除訓練家執照。 請注意，寶可夢聯盟與警察機關是兩個獨立的機構。違反其中一方的規定並不會影響到另一方。  任何註冊訓練家的違規行為都會被通報給寶可夢聯盟。我們總是會知道。\n若要瞭解更多資訊，請聯絡當地的寶可夢中心，或致電 (555) 0123 - PKMN\r寶可夢聯盟總部，冠軍之路#001 郵政號碼：09876\r\r ⬛ 寶可夢中心 面對寶可夢世界中潛藏的許多危險，所有離鄉旅遊的訓練家都需要一個能夠暫時休息的庇護所。\n大多數城鎮都設有寶可夢中心：一個由寶可夢聯盟贊助的場所，讓所有註冊的訓練師和他們的寶可夢都能在這裡過夜，並在需要時接受醫療照顧。\n而最棒的是，這些完全免費！\n訓練家們可能會帶著受傷或疲累的寶可夢隊伍，在其中一間臥房中駐留一晚，並在隔日早晨立刻帶著恢復精神、煥然一新的夥伴們離開。\n多虧了寶可夢中心的治療裝置，鮮少會有需要動用手術治療的情況發生。儘管受到嚴重創傷的寶可夢或許仍需要花費較多的時間回復，但大多數的時候，寶可夢中心的專業團隊能夠在幾個小時之內讓六隻寶可夢的完整隊伍回復健康。\n在設施內通常會配有一名護士和一名治癒士寶可夢，像是吉利蛋、胖可丁、或是差不多娃娃。設施內還有著治療裝置，以及一間為防萬一而準備的急診室。\n在寶可夢中心的二樓有著供寶可夢訓練家們互動的交誼廳、以及讓他們過夜的寢室。這裡同時也提供了正規的寶可夢交換機器給需要的訓練家們使用。\n所有寶可夢中心都會直接向該地區的寶可夢聯盟回報。任何濫用或破壞聯盟規則的訓練家都會被寶可夢中心的職員給處分，他們的執照將會被吊銷或撤除。\n寶可夢中心是一個休息以及和其他訓練家交流的好地方，\n但在設施內戰鬥是被禁止的。\r 當你和你的夥伴感到疲累、需要醫療照顧、或者是單純需要一些關於你所在城鎮的資訊時，寶可夢中心是一個非常值得前去的場所。\n⬛ 寶可夢道館 所有的訓練家都想變得更強、提升自己隊伍的實力、設計出更傑出的戰術。然而，你自己能學到的東西終究有限，那麼如果有這麼一個地方，能讓你跟其他的訓練家互動、對戰、分享訣竅、甚至接受專業訓練家的個人指導呢？\n這正是寶可夢道館的目的。\n在這裡，你可以進行寶可夢對戰來證明自己的強大，或是單純旁觀其他訓練家的戰鬥並從中學習。每個道館都各自專攻不同的寶可夢屬性，且通常有著與之關聯的獨特主題裝潢。\n道館由被稱為「道館館主」的專業訓練家來營運。他或她可能會是在寶可夢聯盟中有著良好紀錄的訓練家。\n具體來說會是什麼？這個嘛，也許他們在水生寶可夢的協助下進行關於海洋的研究、也許他們為了弱小和被遺棄的寶可夢們成立了慈善機構、也可能單純只是他們的對戰實力強勁或經驗豐富。\n無論如何，各地區的聯盟認可這些人們的實力，並且授予了他們寶可夢道館館主的頭銜。\n任何訓練家都能夠前往道館並尋求諮詢、參加他們開設的課程、或是直接向道館館主發起挑戰。\n接受寶可夢對戰的挑戰是他們作為道館館主的責任，但你必須做好經歷一場激鬥的心理準備，因為他們非常強大。如果你贏了，那麼你將會得到道館徽章來證明自己的勝利。\n在設有寶可夢聯盟的地區內，都至少會有八個寶可夢道館。\n想要挑戰寶可夢聯盟舉辦的年度錦標賽的訓練家，必須收集至少八個道館徽章才能得到參加錦標賽的權利。\n⬛ 四天王 顧名思義，四天王是一個四人的團隊，其成員都是在該地區中被證實為強中之強的訓練家；「天王」這個頭銜是寶可夢訓練家所能擁有的最高級榮譽之一。\n要得到這個稱號，你在此之前必須多次獲得聯盟的認可。通常道館館主和其他強大的訓練家會被邀請參加一個特別的錦標賽事，來決定這個賽季的四天王成員。\n在這場特別的錦標賽中，四天王衛冕者們將必須在這些充滿抱負的菁英訓練家及道館館主的競爭中捍衛自己的頭銜。\n雖然四天王的身分顯赫，但他們並不會參與到公共事務之中。他們會出席一些聯盟舉辦的活動，但他們的私生活通常籠罩在秘密與謠言之中。\n唯一可以肯定的是，他們身為訓練家的實力是無庸置疑的。他們寶可夢所展現的純粹力量，毫無疑問只有真正的寶可夢大師才能做到。\n⬛ 冠軍 被稱為「冠軍」，就代表著處於金字塔的頂端。寶可夢聯盟中沒有其他更高的級別，且這個頭銜在訓練家及非訓練家之間都相當受到尊敬。\n每個地區都只會有一名冠軍，他們經常作為寶可夢聯盟的代表出現在大眾面前，並贏得所有人的驚嘆。\n冠軍比寶可夢大師還要高一級，在該地區之中沒有任何寶可夢比他培育的還要更快或更強。\n儘管許多人都夢想著加冕成為冠軍，但要取得聯盟冠軍的殊榮，唯有通過聯盟的艱難挑戰：首先，你必須接連擊敗所有四天王的成員──這是你取得挑戰冠軍資格的唯一途徑；接著，你得在一場竭盡全力的戰鬥中擊敗現任的冠軍，才能取得冠軍頭銜。\n這幾乎是一項不可能達成的壯舉。\n反派 寶可夢世界中同樣存在著犯罪與邪惡，而你最好有心理準備去面對它們。儘管大部分人們都過著和平的生活，但仍有人會想要利用他們的寶可夢去霸凌、破壞、偷竊、或甚至做些更加邪惡的行為。\n雖然警方能夠將大部分的違法者繩之以法，但仍有些犯罪組織因為勢力太過龐大而無法輕易被拿下。\n⬛ 火箭隊 這個案件最初是從一群從弱小訓練家身邊偷走他們寶可夢的混混們起頭。隨後，這些嫌疑犯又關聯到了另一起寶可夢道館徽章盜竊事件，最後甚至與西爾佛公司最高技術機密的搶劫案糾扯不清。而所有警方追查尋回的東西上，全都被標記了一個大大的紅色「R」記號。警方這才終於理解，他們面對的不只是一小搓犯罪份子，而是一個早已準備好引發各種麻煩的龐大組織。\n不久之後，許多與「火箭隊」有關的犯罪事件漸漸浮出水面，其中又以寶可夢搶劫以及私人財產的破壞行為居多。\n無論警方逮捕了多少火箭隊的成員，似乎總還是有更多的成員在暗中蠢蠢欲動，甚至有人懷疑火箭隊很有可能已經滲透進了關都的寶可夢聯盟之中。\n沒有人知道火箭隊的首領到底是誰，因為大多數被捕的成員都只是年輕世代的青年，他們加入的原因通常只是因為朋友也在裡面，加上金錢與權力的誘惑太過誘人的緣故。\n據了解，他們的目標是建立起一個跨越國界的強大犯罪王國。而這個目標，根據一些關於火箭隊員已經滲入城都地區的報告來看，似乎已經漸漸成為現實。\n當你造訪關都和城都地區時，請務必小心，否則你可能會被這高速火箭給狠狠炸飛。\n⬛ 海洋隊＆熔岩隊 豐緣地區的島嶼群中流傳著這麼一個傳說：為了掌控陸地和海洋的支配權，兩頭強大的巨獸之間展開了一場驚天動地的戰鬥。諷刺的是，直至今日，仍有兩幫惡棍相互爭奪著陸與海的領域，並為這個地區帶來了許多麻煩，他們就是「海洋隊」與「熔岩隊」。\n他們最終的目標至今仍不明朗，但可以確定的是，海洋隊的首領水梧桐和熔岩隊的首領赤焰松之間有著巨大的嫌隙，只要有機會，他們就會指使下屬們去阻撓挫敗對方的計畫。\n他們不會找市民或訓練家的麻煩，但他們兩隊的駁火交鋒偶爾仍會波及到一旁無辜的旁觀者。他們都曾經嘗試過偷走潛水艇裝備，但他們的企圖都受到了警察們的努力阻撓。\n⬛ 等離子隊 你可以在合眾地區的公園或其他公共場所看到他們，舉著擴音器與憤怒的標語，宣傳著寶可夢聯盟的恐怖、我們是如何讓寶可夢們成為我們的奴隸，以及我們為何應該還牠們自由。\n這些行為從任何角度來看都沒有違法。但在這個號稱捍衛寶可夢權利與福祉的團隊中還是有幾顆爛蘋果存在。曾有報導指出，「等離子隊」的團員強行奪走訓練家及市民的寶可夢以「解放」牠們。這毫無疑問是寶可夢盜竊罪的一種，也是這個世界中相當嚴重的一種犯罪行為；然而目前警方還沒有足夠的去起訴這些混蛋，因為那些被「偷走」的寶可夢們再也沒有被任何人發現。\n透過他們狂熱的標語，等離子團每一天都有更多的追隨者。距離下次他們綁架偷竊更多的寶可夢，又還要多久呢？\n⬛ 閃焰隊 在密阿雷市的豪華街道以及卡洛斯地區的其他地方，你可以看見這群打扮時尚的奇怪團體在四處遊蕩，他們自稱為「閃焰隊」。\n他們之中的少數人曾因為其可疑的行為而被拘留和訊問，但他們總是說他們的目標只是「創造一個更美好的世界」，並因此被釋放。\n他們打扮得體，說話動聽，甚至連身上的香味也很好聞。\n然而，在洞窟或遠離城市的荒郊裡看到這些優雅的人們仍會讓人有些不安。或許，他們公事包裡頭的東西能揭露出他們組織裏頭骯髒的秘密也說不定。\n現在，這些紅色制服怪咖的行蹤透露出了一種暴風雨前的平靜。但誰知道呢？也許一點星星之火就能引燃閃焰。\n⬛ 銀河隊 沒有人真的知道銀河隊從何而來。當警方意識到他們面對的是一群有組織的犯罪份子時，這個團體早已失去控制。\n「銀河隊」是他們的正式名稱。\n以偷竊高科技武器、太空計劃的研究成果和材料、危險設備、甚至秘密聯邦資產而聞名，他們的目的至今仍然是個謎。\n跟其他的犯罪組織不同，他們並沒有任何已知的招募流程，而且那些被捕的隊員身分也從未曝光。他們長時間潛伏在陰影中，並在奇襲之後又迅速消失無蹤。\n儘管最近的情報指出他們主要活躍於神奧地區，但他們實際上一直都是讓世界各地當局頭痛不已的組織。\n特派調查員已經前往該地區，但在那裏仍可能潛伏著一整個宇宙級的大麻煩。\n⬛ 骷髏隊 被警方認為是所有地區之中最無害的犯罪組織，「骷髏隊」也確實不負眾望！\n他們會插隊！偷走小朋友身上的糖果！在別人打噴嚏時永遠不會說「保重」！\n儘管他們以企圖偷走他人的寶可夢聞名，但所有他們的「受害者」最後都自己回到了主人身邊，而且完全沒有受到任何傷害。\n對於這些在該地區的成年禮中失敗後就引發各種小家子氣麻煩的叛逆孩子，阿羅拉的長者們相當不以為然。\n一位名叫古茲馬的傢伙領導著這群烏合之眾，他們沒有其他的目標，只是為了自娛其樂而惡作劇。\n目前還不清楚他們是如何獲取他們組織的財源，畢竟他們所使用的裝備並不是父母給的零用錢能夠支付的，肯定有什麼人在幕後資助他們。\n希望這些誤入歧途的孩子們能回到學校裡，不要再犯傻了。\n⬛ 吶喊隊 當你造訪伽勒爾地區時，你將會清楚感受到寶可夢對戰在那裡是多麼重要的盛事。\n賽場上總是有著盛大華麗的表演，大批粉絲聚集在一起，呼喊支持著他們最愛的訓練家。但老兄，這裡也存在著狂粉，而吶喊正是他們最擅長的舉動。有些人稱呼他們為「吶喊隊」，他們是一群小流氓組成的毒瘤粉絲，他們會做出任何事情來讓他們支持的訓練家取得優勢。\n封鎖進入會場的通道、操縱競技場、在戰鬥中大聲喊叫分散寶可夢的注意力、綁架裁判、當輸掉比賽時在整個城市鬧事，比賽勝利時則歡騰暴動。\n社群媒體上著名的訓練師「 MaArN1E r0XXy」得到了這個團隊的青睞，並讓他們成為了她的粉絲。他們心中並沒有甚麼統治世界的大計畫，他們只不過想保護自己女王（難得）的微笑。\n最好離他們遠點，不過別擔心，你在幾英哩外就能聽到他們的吶喊。\n由於寶可夢是擔任自我防衛及警方辦案工作的首選，武器在這個世界中相當罕見。儘管它們確實存在且仍然會被使用，但在本規則中並沒有任何列表記錄它們的數據和功能。\n如果你決定在你的故事中使用它們，請將它們視為一種「劇情工具」。\r 本書中並沒有任何關於「劇情工具」的規則。你將必須自行斟酌該如何讓它們在你的故事設定中發揮。\r ⬛ 勁敵 有時候，某人會生活在他人的陰影下，有些人似乎總是更有才華、更受歡迎、更成功。\n不幸的是，這可能就是你會遇到的情況！你的勁敵正是你人生和夢想前方的敵人！這是一場個人的挑戰，證明誰才是更優秀的那個！\n在寶可夢對戰這個競爭激烈的世界中，由於許多人都有著相同的目標，因此擁有一名勁敵關係的對手相對較為普遍。\n勁敵的形式各種各樣，從童年朋友到昔日的死對頭，他可能是好人、是壞人、是熟知的、是神祕的。但是無論他們是什麼樣的人，他們永遠都會是您成為寶可夢大師的夢想的障礙。\n他可以懷抱著任何動機，只要那能讓你的訓練家生活變成一場噩夢即可──不要以為他們會在你的寶可夢旅程中雙手抱胸什麼都不做。\n他的人生將與你的冒險緊緊相關，其程度甚至超乎你的想像。但也多虧了他的存在，你將能夠變得更加堅強茁壯。\n成為一名訓練家 現在你更了解寶可夢的世界了。這世界充滿著美好和危險。但是，這與你又有什麼關係呢？\n在這個遊戲中，你將扮演寶可夢訓練家的角色。\n在這個世界，訓練家是鼓舞激勵他人的源泉，他們是領導力，勇氣，友善和其他許多美德的體現。\n你將生活在這個寶可夢世界中，面對這個世界可能帶給你的考驗。克服困難，解決危機。考驗你和你寶可夢的能力，並努力讓每一天變得更好。\n寶可夢訓練家渴望成為最好的。他們正在進行一場讓自己更加強壯、更加聰慧、更全面性成長的旅途。而他們實現這個目標的方式，將取決於他們在寶可夢世界中所經歷的冒險。挑戰其他訓練家、參加寶可夢競賽、騎乘在他們最為信賴的寶可夢背上；同時，他們也會野外求生，並將這些時光跟他們的朋友一起分享。\n一個全新的冒險世界正在等待你，期許著你盡你所能的做到最好。\n","description":"介紹這個令人驚奇的寶可夢世界。各個地區、各個組織。","id":8,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"神奇的寶可夢世界","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/the-world/"},{"content":"Contest

The Kahuna chiefs and their Pokémon wore special jewels with crystals that shone with energy ready to be unleashed to defend their people.\nThese Jewels are now known as Z-Crystals, if you and your Pokémon hold them and perform the ritual dances, you’ll be able to use what is known as a Z-Move to give a taste of the power of friendship to those who oppose you.\nRules for Z-Moves  To use a Z-Move both Trainer and Pokémon must be holding a Z-Crystal and perform the ritual dance. Z-Moves can only be used once per day. Using them more will cost 5 Will points for the Trainer and the Pokémon. A Pokémon may only use a Z-Move taking as Base a Move of the same Type already on its Move pool. Z- Moves are Physical, Special or Support depending on what the Base Move is. Damaging Z-Moves add points to the Power of the Base Move equal to the total score of Happiness and Loyalty on the Pokémon. Added Effects of the Base Move are replaced by those on the Z-Move. Added Effects and Targets of Z-Moves are fully customizable at Storyteller’s Discretion. Z-Moves cannot be used to Clash.

You’ll be at the mercy of your surroundings.\nAnyone who faints will stay out for an average of 8 hours. After that time, their body will automatically heal itself 1 Damage and the character may regain consciousness.\nThe item Revive allows you to recover from fainting in a few seconds. A regular healing Potion will cure damage made to the body and may prevent the wounds from getting more serious, but the character will remain unconscious.\nFainting is a bad experience for a Pokémon. If you regularly order them to keep fighting until they collapse this will eventually strain your relationship with them by reducing their happiness and loyalty.\nIt is not too wise to risk your Trainer character to faint in a battle. If a Pokémon faints, it can be recalled into its Pokéball and stay secure until it can get treatment; but a fainted trainer will need the aid of other humans to get back on his feet as Pokémon companions cannot apply medicine.\nWild Pokémon will usually cease to attack if the trainer faints and is no longer a menace. But staying out cold completely helpless may put at risk your character’s life.\nLethal Damage (Optional) If you or a Pokémon fall unconscious and keep receiving damage, that damage will become Lethal Damage.\nSome Pokémon can learn devastating moves able to inflict Lethal Damage directly.\nUnlike regular damage, that heals itself over time, receiving Lethal damage involves getting a serious injury that will worsen if left unattended.\nIf the characters suffer 1 lethal damage, they will suffer another lethal damage every hour until they get medical attention or their body cannot hold any longer and the character dies.\nLethal Damage Moves are banned from official League matches, but your Pokémon may still use them if it holds back the full force of the attacks to deal regular damage.\nA move labeled with this Icon Will deal Lethal Damage unless the Pokémon holds back:\n{@icon lethal|l}\nStaying Safe If you suffer Lethal Damage equal to your total HP your character will die. To prevent this, take measures to keep you and your Pokémon safe.\n  Spare no expense in Healing items.\nPotions can be expensive but the life of your Pokémon companions has no price.\n  Teach your Pokémon healing moves. If a Pokémon is able to learn a move that allows it to recover a little health maybe you should give it priority over learning a damaging move.\n  Learn the Medicine Skill.\nThere will be times when the potions run out.\nHaving a Trainer in the party who knows how to find and make medicine out of herbs and berries is a life saver!\n  Evade attacks and find cover. Pokémon battles have flames and energy beams flying everywhere, find a safe place where your trainer can stay out of harm.\n   If a Pokémon or Trainer is going to die, make it meaningful, no sacrifice is ever in vain.\nNo character is disposable.\r Pain Penalizations When your body is injured you will feel pain. As you or your Pokémon receive damage, your movements and overall performance will be impaired due to the wounds. This is what we call Pain Penalization.\nRemove Successes from every Action you attempt,\ndepending on how badly your Character is injured. To measure the amount of pain you’re in, you must take into account your total HP and follow this simple chart:\n\r\rHP State\rPain Penalization\rBody State\r\r\rFull HP\rNone\rNo pain or discomfort.\r\r\rHalf HP (Rounded down)\r1 Removed Success\rPain is now hindering you, moving is difficult.\r\r\r1 HP remaining\r2 Removed Successes\rYou are about to black out. Everything seems blurry and standing is painful.\r\r\rPain Penalizations will be applied to all the actions you make while injured. Rolls for: Accuracy. Damage, All Social Attributes, Strength, Dexterity, Special, and Insight are also affected; however, rolls using Vitality and Will are not.\nPain penalizations will be removed as soon as you heal. If you cannot heal HP, you can also spend 1 Will Point to ignore 1 Removed Success from penalizations for the rest of the scene.\nPain penalization may be assigned without receiving damage.\nFor example when the characters are exhausted by exercise, lack of food or sleep.\r ","description":"","id":11,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"傷害","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/pokemon-battle/damage/"},{"content":"Multiple Actions (Optional) This is where you get fast and furious. You can abuse your speed and intellect to divide your attention and perform multiple tasks at the same time.\nMost common use is in battle; you can attack, evade and support your allies, but Multiple Actions are not limited to fights.\nMaybe you want to read a book while driving a car, or maybe you want to catch a ball and kick your foe while dodging bullet seeds. I’m not saying that everything is possible, but you can at least try! Worst case scenario: You die.\nAll you have to do is:\nRoll the dice pool for your action. However, every Action beyond the first, will require 1 additional Success.\nMultiple ActionRequired Successes\r1st Action 1 \r2nd Action 2 \r3rd Action 3 \r4th Action 4 \r5th Action 5 \r\rPain Penalizations, Low Accuracy, and other penalties may substract Successes from your Rolls.\nYou may perform up to 5 multiple actions each round, and it gets harder and harder the more you push your skills, if you are not skilled enough you risk suffering a Critical Failure.\nWhen a Pokémon is acting on its own, they usually won’t make more than one or two actions, even if they are capable of doing more.\r You can take your 2nd action only after everybody else had a chance to act, the only exceptions being: Successive Actions and Evasion/Clash.\nIf you make lots of actions it means that you are moving really quick.

Learn them all and any Pokémon at your side will be champion material.\n⬛ Holding Action When you declare to hold your action your character will remain immobile looking at the foe, this will seem like an invitation to the foe or someone else to act before you do.\nYou may use the action you were holding at any point during the round.\nIf both you and your foe hold action the round will end with no further actions.\nIt means that both sides paused the fight to eye each other warily\u0026hellip;\n⬛ Evading It is always a smart move to get away from danger. You may do this by evading attacks or finding cover.\nOnce per Round you can Evade an attack, simply have to give the order “Evade it!” or “Dodge!”. Your Pokémon will understand that danger is coming its way and will react as fast as possible.\nAn Evasion action can be triggered regardless of initiative order at the cost of an action. All you need to do is Roll:\nDexterity + Evasion\rIf you score as many Succesess as your foe, you evade the attack.\nEvading counts as an Action, thus, acting again this Round will require another Success as stated on the table for Multiple Actions.\nEvasion can be performed only once per Round.\n\n⬛ Clashing Attacks Some Pokémon are not dexterous enough to be constantly evading, but they can rely on their sheer power to fend off their foe’s attacks by doing what we call a Clash.\nOnce per Round, when an opponent makes its Accuracy Roll you can order your Pokémon to use one of its own Damaging Moves (i.e. Thunderbolt, Water Gun, Close Combat) to try to deflect most of the damage . Simply Roll:\nStrength/Special + Clash\rIf you score as many Succesess as your foe, you clash the attack and both your foe and your Pokémon will suffer 1 damage instead of the foe making a damage roll.\nClashing counts as an Action, thus, acting again this Round will require another Success as stated on the table for Multiple Actions.\nAll Damage taken from a Clash is affected by the Super Effective and It’s Not Very Effective rule.\nWhile not as effective as Evasion to reduce damage intake, Clashing attacks is a good option for slower but strong and resilient Pokémon.\nClash can be performed only once per Round.\n\nOnce you use a Move for a Clash you can’t repeat it during the same Round; You’ll have to wait until the next one!\r Support Moves, Moves that ignore Defenses and Moves that have a Set Damage can’t be Clashed.\r ⬛ Taking Cover This action will help you resist damage against Ranged attacks depending on much of your body is covered.\nBody Coverage Bonus Def/SDef vs Ranged Attacks \r1/4 +1 \r1/2 +2 \rFull Cover must be destroyed \r\rIt is possible to avoid damage completely at Storyteller’s Discretion. A Cover may be destroyed after taking a few hits.\nYou can use the Maneuver “Cover an Ally” to use your body as a shield for a small Pokémon.\nOr you can make a big Pokémon use it to cover yourself!\r ⬛ Same Type Attack Bonus (STAB) All Pokémon can control different Types of energy, but these energies will come out naturally stronger if they are from thier own Type.\nFor example, a Grass-Type is stronger at controlling plants, while a Normal-type won\u0026rsquo;t be as powerful when trying to do the same.\nUsing Moves that match their own type will give you an edge when trying to deal damage.\nWhenever a Pokémon performs an Attack that matches one of its types you’ll get the “Same Type Attack Bonus” or STAB for short.\nThis adds 1 Bonus Dice to the Damage Pools of matching Type attacks.\n ⬛ Low Accuracy Moves If you perform a move labeled with a sign like this:\n{@icon frame|accuracy|命中|down|1}{@icon frame|accuracy|命中|down|2}{@icon frame|accuracy|命中|down|3}\nRemove the noted number of Successes from your Accuracy Roll.\nTake a look at this example:\nPikachu is trying to attack its foe Stunky with the move Thunder. Which has an Accuracy of -2: {@icon dice|l|5}Pikachu’s Dice Pool, with {@icon frame|accuracy|命中|down|2} Move Accuracy\nRoll Results: {@icon rdice|s|1}{@icon rdice|s|6|fail}{@icon rdice|s|3}{@icon rdice|s|4|fail}{@icon rdice|s|3} (-2 Successes)\nThe roll fails. A Thunder stroke in the arena but it did not hit the target.\nOn Stunky’s turn he uses the move Smokescreen reducing Pikachu’s Accuracy by 1.\nIn the next Round, Pikachu’s Accuracy Roll for Thunder would be:\n{@icon dice|l|5}Pikachu’s Dice Pool, with {@icon frame|accuracy|命中|down|3} Move Accuracy\nRoll Results: {@icon rdice|s|1}{@icon rdice|s|6|fail}{@icon rdice|s|6|fail}{@icon rdice|s|4|fail}{@icon rdice|s|2} (-3 Successes)\nPikachu would have to train its skills to get better at controlling this kind of attacks.\n Pain Penalizations and other penalties may remove even more successes from your Roll.\nThe power of some Moves might seem tempting, but you’ll need a lot more than powerful moves to win your battles.\nIf your foe is relying on powerful but unaccurate Moves, don’t be scared, make their advantage become their disadvantage by Evading or Clashing.\n⬛ Attributes: Increase \u0026amp; Reduction You will notice that some moves are marked with this kind of icons:\n{@icon frame|self|特質|up|1}{@icon frame|self|特質|down|1} {@icon frame|target|特質|up|1}{@icon frame|target|特質|down|1}\nMost of them don’t deal damage but increase or reduce the attributes of a Pokémon instead.\nIt is a valid strategy to reduce your foe’s Attributes to get an advantage. If you combine this with increasing your own Pokémon Attributes, you will be on the right path to victory.\nA Move may increase or decrease an attribute by 1, 2 or 3 points, this effect is only temporary.\nThese points do not stack on the same attribute, but instead only take into account the move with the highest modifier.\nA Shellder with a Defense of 5 used the move Withdraw as its first action.\nIts Defense will be increased 1 point making it a total of 6.\nOn its next action, Shellder used the move Iron Defense, which increases its Defense by 2 points. Its Defense will now be 7. The effects of Withdraw are replaced.\nIf Shellder uses Iron Defense once again the next round, its Defense would remain unchanged.\n The same rule applies for decreasing the attributes of a Pokémon, with the only exception that once an attribute is decreased to just 1 point, it cannot be decreased further.\nSome Held Items will directly affect the attributes of a Pokémon but their effects will not stack along with the effects of a move and you will take into account only the highest modifier.\nTemporary increases of attributes can only make a Pokémon reach a maximum of 10 Points.\nThat means that if your Pokémon already has a score of 10 in an attribute it won’t be able to increase it further.\nIf your Pokémon has reached the limit score on its attribute, and increases it using a move or ability, as long as it keeps it on 10 or less it will be able to do so without problems.\nWhen combined with Abilities, Pokémon can achieve incredible power through temporary increases in Power, Defense and Speed.\nTake these examples of combining moves and abilities to increase your own attributes or reduce your foe’s:\nYour Floatzel has 4 points of Dexterity. Its Ability is Swift Swim, which increases Dexterity by 2 Points during Rain weather.\nIt is raining at the moment and Floatzel uses the Move Agility in its turn. This move adds 2 Points to the user’s Dexterity.\nFloatzel ends up with 8 total Dexterity Points: 4 points are its own, 2 from its Ability and 2 more from the Move it used.\nYour little pink Snubull goes into battle, against an aggressive Tyranitar with a Strength score of 4. Fortunately, Snubull has the ability Intimidate, which reduces by 1 point the Strength of all foes in range.\nOn its turn, Snubull uses the move Charm, which means a further reduction of 2 points for the foe. By the end of Snubull’s turn, Tyranitar only has 1 point on its Strength Attribute.\nNow that doesn’t sound too menacing!\n\nIt is illegal to go into an official match of the league with your Pokémon already buffed. You’ll have to put it back into its Pokéball and let it out when the match begins.\r All these Power-ups and downs are only temporary.\nThey will last for a scene or until the Pokémon is removed from battle.\n⬛ Critical Hit To land a Critical Hit you have to score 3 more successes than what is required for your Accuracy Roll.\nIf you do, you will add 2 dice to your Damage Pool.\nArchen is fighting Amaura. Archen managed to land a Critical-Hit with the move Crunch.\nThis will be Archen’s Damage Pool:\n{@icon dice|m|4} Archen’s Strength\n+ {@icon dice|m|3} Crunch’s Power\n+ {@icon dice|m|2} Critical Hit Bonus\n- {@icon dice|m|2} Amaura’s Defense\nAmaura is at risk of receiving a serious amount of damage from Archen’s Attack!\n Also, Moves labeled with this Icon:\n{@icon crit|l}\nAre called “High-Critical” moves.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll need only 2 more Successes than necessary, to get a Critical hit!\n⬛ Holding Back Sometimes it will be more convenient to contain the full force of your Pokémon’s attacks.\nPerhaps a move is extremely powerful but it may hurt your allies as well, maybe you are fighting a wild Pokémon you want to catch and do not want it to faint. Or it could be that you are participating in an official League Tournament and you cannot use your favorite move by going all out.\nFor those cases, you give the command to “Hold Back” in order to do either of the next options:\n  Deal Half Damage.\nYou make your damage roll normally but only inflict half of the damage rounded down to those affected by your attack.\n  Deal Regular Damage instead of Lethal Damage.\nIf your order your Pokémon to use a move that would deal Lethal Damage: {@icon lethal|l}\n  You can also add the order: “Restrain yourself!”, “Don’t use full force!” or something along the lines so the damage your Pokémon inflicts will not need a trip to the emergency room \u0026hellip;or the graveyard.\n⬛ Priority and Low Priority Many actions and Moves are quick and abrupt or slow and complex. Priority and Low Priority are terms to indicate which Moves get into effect outside of the normal Initiative order. They are labeled by these signs:\n{@icon frame|priority|優先度|up|1}{@icon frame|priority|優先度|down|1}\nThey represent Priority, which allows a Pokémon to act right away even if it’s not their turn yet.\nAnd Low Priority, in which the Pokémon will use its move but it will take effect at the End of the Round.\nIn case two Pokémon are using a Priority move at the same time, the move with higher Priority number will be resolved first. In case both have the same priority number, the initiative order will determine who resolves it first. Take into account: once you announce a Priority Move, your foe may change his order/action to an Evasion, or it may use another Priority Move.\nLow Priority is the opposite, it will take effect at the End of the Round, it may look like the foe is holding their action while in reality, it is just about to strike.\n⬛ Healing In-Battle There are three ways to heal a character in-battle:\n By applying healing items, such as Spray Potions or medicine on them. One Potion unit heals 1 damage, two units heal 1 lethal damage. By using a held item such as a Berry. By using moves that restore your health. These moves may require the user to spend 1 Will Point to get the benefits.  Humans cannot use healing moves but can have Pokémon use some of their moves on them, they also can’t have a held item but they are free to use a berry or medicine and apply it on themselves or their Pokémon.\nNow, while the healing in this world can be miraculously fast, a 10-second Round is too-short a time to make a full recovery from some wounds.\nWhen you are in battle, potions, berries and Moves can only heal a maximum of 3 HP per round.\nComplete Heal, Max Potion, and Full Restore are the only things able to heal more.\n Some Pokémon are able to learn moves that restore health. They are identified with this icons:\n{@icon heal|l}\rBasic Heal \rHeal regular damage equal to 3 HP.\r\r\r{@icon c_heal|l}\rComplete Heal \rHeal regular and Lethal damage equal to 5 HP.\r\r\r{@icon frame|heal|治療|heal|2}\rFixed Heal \rFor example: Heal up to 2 Damage.\r\r\r{@icon frame|heal|治療|c_heal|2}\rFixed Complete Heal \rFor example: Heal up to 2 Lethal Damage.\r\r\rIf your Pokémon makes the Accuracy roll to activate a move labeled with any of these icons and succeeds, you need to spend 1 Will Point in order to get their benefits. If the Accuracy roll fails you don’t need to spend the Will Point.\nHealing Moves are not infinite, Your Pokemon’s Will score can run out before recovering all of its HP.\nAlways carry Potions!\r You can only heal 3 HP per round when using Potions and most healing moves, but moves identified with this icon.\n{@icon c_heal|l}\rComplete Heal \rAre able to heal up to 5 HP per round.\r\r\rOnce you reach the healing limit or the Subject restores its full HP, the recovery stops and any remaining points will be lost.\nTake this example:\nYour Meganium is fighting a wild Pokémon and you order it to use the move Grassy Terrain.\nOne of the effects of Grassy Terrain is this:\n{@icon frame|heal|治療|heal|1}\nFor the next 4 Rounds, User and Allies on the ground Restore 1 HP at the End of the Round.\nThe battle continues and Meganium receives a brutal strike, it has 2 HP remaining from its total HP of 9. It needs healing ASAP. You run to its aid with a Potion in hand and apply 3 units of Potion that will restore 3 HP to Meganium. However, the HP healed from Grassy Terrain won’t take effect this round and won’t carry on to the next one.\nA couple of rounds pass and someone activated Sunny Weather in the field, Meganium has 5 HP so you order it to use the move Synthesis, one of its effects being:\n{@icon c_heal|l}\nIf Sunny Weather is in effect this Move becomes a Complete Heal.\nThis means it would recover 5 HP, but Meganium’s only has taken 4 damage, So it heals 4 HP and the remaining point is lost.\n ⬛ Shield Moves There are some moves labeled with this icon:\n{@icon shield|l}\nTheir effects may differ from one another but they all have one thing in common, they are actions that involve using a shield against an incoming attack.\nUnlike evading, Pokémon using these moves receive the attacks head-on with certainty that they’ll come out practically unscathed. Shield Moves can reduce damage to zero.\nThere’s a catch, though. You can only use one shield move per round, and if you use one the next round as well you\u0026rsquo;ll get an Extra -2 Reduced Accuracy to their accuracy roll, increasing the chances of failure for every shield move you use each round. If you do not use a shield move for a whole round this effect resets.\nFor every Shield Move you use round after round, you’ll be adding an extra reduced Accuracy.\nThat means:\nShield Move on Round 1\n{@icon shield|l}\nShield Move on Round 2\n{@icon shield|l} + {@icon frame|accuracy|命中|down|2}\nShield Move on Round 3\n{@icon shield|l} + {@icon frame|accuracy|命中|down|4}\nAnd so on if you keep using them uninterruptedly.\n ⬛ Successive Actions Multiple Actions are handled per round. But some moves have the special property of unleashing all actions at once, these are called “Succesive Actions”\nMoves marked with this symbols:\n{@icon d_act|l} {@icon s_act|l}\nMean that you can unleash from 2 to 5 multiple actions in a single attack!\nMeowth will use the move Fury Swipes, which is a Successive Action move.\nFor it’s Accuracy roll, Meowth will roll following the Multiple Actions rule for successes, only this time the actions called will be released all at once. Trainer calls for 2 multiple actions to be used on Fury Swipes:\nMeowth’s first Swipe:\n{@icon dice|l|5}Meowth’s Dice Pool, with {@icon frame|accuracy|命中|down|1} Move Accuracy\nRoll Results: {@icon rdice|s|2}{@icon rdice|s|3}{@icon rdice|s|4|fail}{@icon rdice|s|5}{@icon rdice|s|1} (1 Required Successes)\nMeowth’s second Swipe:\n{@icon dice|l|5}Meowth’s Dice Pool, with {@icon frame|accuracy|命中|down|1} Move Accuracy\nRoll Results: {@icon rdice|s|3}{@icon rdice|s|1}{@icon rdice|s|4}{@icon rdice|s|5}{@icon rdice|s|5|fail} (2 Required Successes)\nAll of this means that Meowth performed two attacks in a single turn, and if its Dice pool grows with some training, Meowth will be capable of making up to 5 attacks in a single Turn!\n ","description":"","id":15,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"勝利策略","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/pokemon-battle/strategies-to-win/"},{"content":"Coordinator Ranks We mentioned before that Rank is a representation of time and effort put into a particular lifestyle, There are Ranks for activities besides Pokémon Training, these Ranks will add benefits to your Character.\nIf you dedicate yourself to winning Contests you will be able to gain Coordinator Ranks, these do not replace your Pokémon Trainer Rank but add to it.\nThink about it as a specialization to being a Pokémon Trainer.\nCoordinators have their own types of skills that benefit them greatly in social situations.

They enjoy the simple things in life and are quite sensitive to other’s emotions. They are very conscious about their own weaknesses and will try to make them better, but it hurts them to be pushed around and they may feel intimidated or disheartened if the challenges are too big. They need a strong figure who believes in them to feel confident but the fact that they are aware of their own weakness is a great advantage though.\n 大膽\r信心值: 9\r\r冒險精神、自信、勇敢\rReal thrill seekers. The Bold view life with optimism and excitement, they firmly believe one must go forward no matter the consequences. They are easily provoked and quick to take action, often heading into challenges a lot bigger than themselves.

Others look up to them as they inspire confidence and trust. They strive to conquer their fears and wish to inspire others to do the same. They keep it together when stress begins to escalate.\n 溫和\r信心值: 8\r\r通情達理、和平、均衡\rPeace and tranquility is the most important thing for those with a Calm nature. They are not noisy nor they want many thrills in their lives. Conflict is not welcome and they tend to be peacemakers. It is rare to see them fall for provocations as they keep their distance and composure when facing trouble. They dislike stress and overbearing attention, but their presence is pleasant and soothing.\n 慎重\r信心值: 5\r\r善於分析、多疑的、內斂的\rThose with this nature will often ponder their options according to the level of risk. If the benefit is substantial but the risk is too great they will prefer an option less rewarding but also less risky. They may take some time to warm up to strangers and will always be alert to their surroundings. Keeping a situation under control is important for them, not being in control makes them anxious and stressed. If things get out of hand they might run away to fight another day.\n 坦率\r信心值: 7\r\r善良、團隊合作、服務精神\rAlways with a courteous disposition, a Docile nature indicates that you put others before yourself. Those under this nature love to please and be of assistance to their companions and community.

The word “disheartened” is not for them, they have a great tolerance for stress and frustration so they rarely get worked up.\nYou’ll rarely find them unprepared.

They’ll help you get through the hardest of scenarios.\n 急躁\r信心值: 7\r\r熱切、熱情、急促\rEnergetic, spontaneous and a little impulsive.\nThey live in the moment and don’t have time to mop about past losses or worry about future battles. They are eager to see what comes next, moving from one thing to another. They rarely stress out because they make their lives on the go and rarely sit to relax or meditate things through.

They carry themselves with a light heart but you can also see a smug smirk on their faces. Playful, irreverent and agile of mind, they dislike routine and chores. They are the kind to circle around a problem as a head-on confrontation will stress them.\nThey also want a little validation from others so they\u0026rsquo;ll get attention as the pranksters of the group.\n 爽朗\r信心值: 10\r\r開朗、迷人、精力充沛\rThey love to spread happiness around and will always have a smile to give you.

Is not that they are lazy, they just don’t see the need to waste energy on stuff that’s not important for them yet. Since they don’t care to fill anyone’s expectations they rarely stress out about social norms, but they\u0026rsquo;ll need a reason to keep motivated and an even better reason to be pro-active instead of indifferent.\n 寂寞\r信心值: 5\r\r獨立、內省、孤獨\rThey like to keep their distance and do everything on their own. They often feel it’s up to them and nobody else to get things done and will take the burden of a responsibility that should be shared.\nInteracting with others is like a chore for them but being isolate also makes them feel misunderstood. They are hard to get close to but they can be trusted to do their best even if there\u0026rsquo;s no one to guide them.\n 慢吞吞\r信心值: 8\r\r溫順、寧靜、令人舒適\r“Harmless” is the word that best describes a Mild nature. They are patient and calm with others, reliable and caring on every matter. Because of this, others seek their company as stability ground. They seek to understand others and have a natural talent to do it. They tend to keep their needs to themselves and sometimes stay in the background, but they are the ones to turn when you need someone to listen.\n 內斂\r信心值: 10\r\r謹慎、自信、努力家\rWhen you are aware of your potential you don’t need others to praise you for it. A modest nature knows the reward is the constant improvement of their abilities, not the acknowledging of others. They won’t show off nor will they feel diminished when others display better capabilities. They’ll do their best always and the only one who may judge the right or wrong of their ways is themselves.\n 天真\r信心值: 7\r\r好奇、無憂無慮、純真\rThe world is full of wonder; there is always something new to discover and many others to befriend. A Naive nature is a curious and innocent nature, they easily trust others because they ignore the many dan\u0002gers of the world. They still have a lot to learn but they take life as it comes. They rarely stress out due to the fact they still don\u0026rsquo;t know there are many things to stress about. A friend\u0026rsquo;s smile and a hand to take it\u0026rsquo;s all they need.\n 頑皮\r信心值: 6\r\r狡猾、叛逆、惡作劇\rWhy should they listen to you? You are not their boss! Most of the time they’ll deliberately do the opposite from what’s expected from them. Why? Because they can, of course. They love to see others get mad and will use their clever mind and cunning to get away with their misdeeds. When they stress they put a cool facade, don\u0026rsquo;t let that fool you. They need to be coaxed or put in their place to behave properly.\n 冷靜\r信心值: 5\r\r沉默、含蓄、觀測者\rLife is what happens around those with a Quiet nature. They often take a passive stance over the circumstances around them. Strong thoughts or opinions they have will rarely be expressed, so they are not the greatest at social interactions. They may be afraid to make a mistake or consider it a hassle to take action. When they manage to get the attention of others they rarely know what to do with themselves.\n 古怪\r信心值: 9\r\r奇特的、能接受新思想、獨創的\rYou can’t really understand how their mind works. Those who have a Quirky nature will usually see the world in a unique way that only they seem to comprehend. The way they act will be peculiar and often attract puzzled looks, they know they are oddballs and are fine with it, but they might get stressed by the strangest of things. The way they see the world is so unique that they accept new things easily.\n 馬虎\r信心值: 6\r\r魯莽、粗俗、蠻勇\rThey are reckless, and exposing themselves to danger is their idea of fun. Blunt and direct in the way they act with others, you are either their friend or you are their enemy. They are known for rushing into action with a “hit first, ask later” mentality. They are also famous for their quick-temper, loud-mouth, and foolhardy deeds, so don\u0026rsquo;t expect them to keep their cool when stress starts to elevate.\n 悠閒\r信心值: 8\r\r無憂無慮、深思的、漠不關心\rThe problems of the world are not their problems. A Relaxed nature will allow its bearer to take it easy and never lose their cool. They will never stress over trivial matters and won’t instigate trouble. Should disputes arise, they will invite others to calm down through breathing and meditation, they go with the flow, never against it. Some may call them carefree, they will call themselves enlightened.\n 自大\r信心值: 7\r\r活潑、失禮、嘮叨\rThey have an attitude, and those who take themselves too seriously may dislike it, but the Sassy natured are simply not afraid to voice their honest opinion and will always find ways to speak their mind and it\u0026rsquo;s always brutally honest, so be ready for some burns.\nThere are no middle grounds with them, they either love or hate something so they can be infuriatingly difficult or surprisingly easy to deal with, that is part of their charm.\n 認真\r信心值: 4\r\r堅定、死板、忠誠的\rThey have a big sense of responsibility and won’t appreciate when others don’t take things seriously. Stress is a constant in their lives, if they have a duty to fulfill they will not stop until it’s finished, everything else is a useless distraction once they have a task. They might need a hand since have a hard time relaxing but if you want things done well they are the ones to look for.\n 膽小\r信心值: 4\r\r害羞、憂慮、有意識\rThey have built walls around themselves that make it hard for others to see what’s inside. They just want to be accepted but tend to worry too much and be way too harsh on themselves.\nTheir confidence is usually placed on a leader figure and this makes them eager to please but also terrified to fail. They need to learn to trust in their own capabilities to reach their full potential.\n \rfunction appendToC(){\rvar natureList = Object.values(document.getElementsByClassName(\"Nature\")).map(n = n.children[0].children[0].innerText)\rvar toc = document.getElementById(\"TableOfContents\");\rif(toc!=null){\rvar natureTocList = document.createElement(\"UL\");\rnatureList.forEach( id = {\rvar textNode = document.createTextNode(id);\rvar urlNode = document.createElement(\"A\");\rurlNode.setAttribute(\"href\", \"#\"+id);\rurlNode.appendChild(textNode);\rvar listNode = document.createElement(\"LI\");\rlistNode.appendChild(urlNode);\rnatureTocList.appendChild(listNode);\r});\rtoc.children[0].lastElementChild.appendChild(natureTocList);\rwindow.onscroll(true);\r}\r}\rwindow.addEventListener(\"load\", appendToC);\r  ","description":"羅列各性格的說明和對應數值","id":17,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"性格","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/natures/"},{"content":"技能與額外技能 你會需要技能來讓你們的冒險旅程更容易，協助你度過各種各樣的狀況。你的寶可夢們能夠自己學會一些技能，但你也可訓練牠們，使牠們變得更強大。\n技能是各種應用知識的匯總。\n它們可以涵蓋相當廣泛的情境，且不一定要特指於某個領域或學科。\n這個世界上有著許多不同的技能，要同時熟練或精通它們基本上是不可能的。儘管角色卡上列出那些與冒險故事最相關的技能，但你仍能學習任何你想要的技藝：耕種栽培、吟詩作對，或任何你想像得到的事物。你可以使用「額外技能」來紀錄任何沒有列在角色卡上的其他技能。\n記住，絕大多數的寶可夢都需要訓練師的指導才能學會未列在牠們角色卡上的技能。\n技能必須和特質一起擲骰，你永遠不能單獨拿技能來擲骰。\n每當你需要藉助你天生身體、心理、或社交力之外的技藝能力來取得成功時，每一點技能點都能夠增加一顆骰子到你擲骰使用的骰池之中。\n大部分的行動擲骰會要求你使用: 某個特質 + 某個技能\n透過組合它們來獲得最符合你所採取行動的骰池。 另外值得注意的一點，你分配在同一個技能上的點數不能超過你階級所設定的技能上限，你需要更努力的鍛鍊才能夠進一步專精它們。\n⬛ 戰鬥類技能 拳打腳踢、啃咬、拉扯毛髮。為了在戰鬥中取勝，你需要知道該怎麼做。這些技能將定義你的戰鬥方式，你可以選擇專精一項或分散投資它們，一切都取決於你打算遵循什麼樣的策略。\n鬥毆 你專注於近身戰鬥，透過拳擊、腳踢、擒抱、啃咬等方式進行接觸。\n導引 寶可夢能夠控制牠們屬性的能量，使用這個技能可以讓牠們更好地進行遠程攻擊。\n對抗 寶可夢的攻擊經常在戰鬥期間互相衝突對抗，使用這個技能來用你自己的攻擊去阻擋對手的攻擊。\n閃避 躲避攻擊是你最為擅長的，你專注於尋找掩護、跳離攻擊範圍、或透過身體的流體運動來最小化承受的傷害。\n投擲 訓練家可以使用這個技能準確地投擲精靈球、石頭、誘餌、飛鏢、或是其它投擲物。\n武器 人類不會任何寶可夢招式，但當寶可夢不在身邊時，他們可以使用武器和陷阱來保護自己。\n本系統並沒有提供武器清單。 你必須自行決定這些武器會有多強大。\r ⬛ 生存類技能 無論你想要徒步穿越荒野、或只是在城市裡漫步，你都需要之到如何避免潛伏在每個角落的危險。\n警覺 這個技能代表著你感官的敏銳程度，它可能會是良好的視力、優秀的聽覺、或傑出的嗅覺。保持警戒有助於你更快地對危險做出反應。\n運動 奔跑、攀爬、跳躍、游泳、倒立行走！你知道如何充分發揮自己的身體能力。\n自然 從頭開始生火、分辨哪種植物可以食用、搭建遮蔽處，理解大自然的循環，這些都能幫助你利用大地的恩寵。\n隱匿 避免危險最佳的方法就是不要讓它找到你。你訓練自己變得迅捷而安靜，與周圍環境融為一體從而避免被發現。\n⬛ 競賽類技能 這些技能涵蓋了所有你在寶可夢華麗大賽和大多數社交場合中取得出色表現需要的一切，因此精進這些技能也許能讓你擺脫不必要的戰鬥。\n誘惑 無論是為了贏得你的好感或避免遭受攻擊，寶可夢經常會試著讓你覺得牠們對你感興趣。你的行為給他人的感受能有多真誠，就取決於這個技能的程度了。\n共感 人類是具有同理心的生物。這個技能被用來衡量你你同理他人感受、以擊分享他們喜怒哀樂的能力。\n禮儀 有些情境會需要你表現出良好的行為舉止，展現出優雅、教養、溫柔、和風度。正是它們決定了王子與貧民的差別。\n威嚇 在某些情境下，你會需要凶狠的瞪視、說出尖銳的評論、或適時從座位上站起來。威嚇技能在你需要強迫或操縱他人按你的希望做事時相當有用。\n表演 跳舞、唱歌、扮演、模仿、和虛張聲勢！如果你專精於表演技能，那麼所有你用來展現出令人信服的演出所需的行動都會表現得更好。\n⬛ 知識類技能 人們在他們的生活需要瞭解許許多多的事情。有些人只是學習他們在學校被教導的知識，而有些人則會選擇踏上智慧之道去尋求答案。\n寶可夢需要擁有優異的洞察和聰慧特質（4 或以上）才能掌握這些概念。\n工藝 你能夠藉著雙手、工具、和一些材料來建造出任何物品。像是繪畫、雕刻、烹飪、修理等等。\n傳聞 關於不同種類寶可夢的知識，牠們的傳說和民間故事、以及該地區稀有寶可夢的位置和起源。\n醫藥 如果你專精於醫藥技能，那麼你會知道如何處理傷口、急救、用藥、甚至發明你自己獨特的醫療方法。\n科學 選擇任何你想要的科學或研究領域。例如：電腦、科技、化學、物理學、地質學、工程學、寶可夢進化學等。你可以選擇任何你想要的領域！\n你能繼續學習並追加選擇其他「科學」領域來進一步專業化。\n⬛ 額外技能 有時候你會需要某個未被列在角色卡上的技能，這些技能必須在說書人的判斷同意下才能被獲得。\n寶可夢需要透過訓練師的指導才能獲得這些技能。\n","description":"說明各個技能的意義和用途","id":18,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"技能","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/starting-the-game/skills/"},{"content":"Max Moves Dynamax and G-Max Pokémon\rSo you think you are ready for the BIG leagues?\nWhen a Pokémon is under the Effects of the Dynamax Phenomenon it grows not just on size but on power as well and Max Moves will ad an extra layer of complexity to your strategy!\nRules for Max Moves  Max Moves can only be used while a Pokémon is under the Effects of Dynamax or Gigantamax.

Most Pokémon you find in towns and cities are the descendants of wild Pokémon that were domesticated by trainers generations ago. They have been bred and taught to be friendly, loyal, and obedient; They\u0026rsquo;ll adapt to their owner\u0026rsquo;s Rank and depend on their Trainer to get stronger.\nBut Pokémon that live in the wild can be either Pokémon turned feral after being abandoned or Pokémon that have lived with no human contact all their lives, this has made them grow their Rank through sheer prowess and survival instinct.\nWhatever the case, both kinds of wild Pokémon are distrustful of humans and even jealous of their Pokémon companions. Some will flee in fear, others will get aggressive and do everything to protect themselves from what they see as a threat to their survival.\nWild Pokémon have honed skills of survival that human-raised Pokémon do not have. Also, there are species that have not been tamed nor domesticated due to their formidable strength. Catching one of these specimens would give you an advantage over the other trainers; And they can teach you as much about teamwork, nature and following your instincts as you can teach them about the human world.\nHabitats The world of Pokémon is big, if not bigger than ours. There are places where certain kinds of Pokémon are drawn to, and there are Pokémon that can only be found in certain parts of the globe.\nExperienced Trainers don’t go around the world throwing Pokéballs at everything that moves. They study the habitats of the Pokémon and seek for a specimen that seems good-natured or try to gain the trust and respect of a Pokémon that seems especially wary.\nSome Pokémon are so rare that people don’t know if they are real or legends. To find them, trainers have to venture into uncharted areas.\r Special Pokémon Around the world, there are Pokémon that do not fit their species stereotypes. While every Pokémon is unique, these Pokémon have special qualities to them that can make them literally one in a million. Traits like a different color pattern, a bigger size and even moves or abilities that defy their nature.\n⬛ Shiny Pokémon, Alternate Forms \u0026amp; Regional Variants. Some Pokémon have a different coloration in their fur, hide, feathers or scales. This change can be aesthetic or it can involve a change in Typing, Attribute Limits, Moves and/or Abilities.\nShiny Pokémon are distinguished by the sparkles they leave behind as if they were coated in a glittery dust. Their exotic look makes them highly appreciated in beauty contests and people will pay incredibly high amounts of money to get their hands on one, their appearance does not affect their Type or Attributes.\nAlternate Forms refer to Pokémon of the same species that somehow look different from each other although with some resemblance still. They can have different Types, Attributes and Abilities.\nSome Pokémon may even change forms at will.\nRegional Variants are Alternate forms of Pokémon that can only be found in certain regions, they are the result of introducing foreign Pokémon into an established habitat, over the generations the Pokémon have to adapt to this new environment, this can make them change their type, abilities, move set and even make evolve into something their regular counterparts cannot.\n⬛ Overgrown Pokémon Most Pokémon have a standard size and weight, but there are reported cases of Pokémon that could be considered giants within their own species. Overgrown Pokémon are usually around 30% to 60% bigger than their regular-sized counterparts but they are very rare to find. Their main characteristic is that their size and weight keep proportion.\nMany trainers have overfed their Pokémon with the hopes of making them bigger, only to end up making them fatter. An overgrown Pokémon is born that way. Even if at birth it has a normal size, it will keep growing until it reaches maturity.\nOvergrown Pokémon have a higher Base HP than their regular-sized counterparts.\nIncrease their Base HP by 1\r⬛ Hidden Moves and Abilities There are records in this world’s history that depict certain Pokémon using powers and Abilities different from those normally seen on them.\nOnly a few proficient trainers like Gym Leaders and Elites are known for owning at least one of this Special Pokémon.\nHowever, it is unknown if they captured their Pokémon with those rare abilities or somehow they worked with them to attain them.\nStoryteller\u0026rsquo;s discretion should be applied for Pokémon to have Moves and/or Abilities it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t normally have.\nUsing Pokéballs If you want to catch a Wild Pokémon, you are gonna need Pokéballs. You can buy them at any Pokémart. Greatballs and Ultraballs can be more expensive than a regular Pokéball, but in the end, they can save you money by not breaking apart when you need to capture a powerful Pokémon.\nWhen you capture a Pokémon within a Pokéball, the chip will be branded with your Trainer’s ID. That way other Trainer’s Pokéballs won’t be able to trap your Pokémon to steal it.\nPokéballs can’t carry Humans, rooted objects like trees or mountain boulders, machinery that contains a lot of small pieces such as motor vehicles and electronics.\nBig objects like tents, bicycles, and potions in bulk are sold with their own Pokéball for easy storage. Once a Pokéball is used to carry something inside it gets coded into it and cannot carry anything else. Just like with Pokémon, the item it carries will have your ID number and can be retrieved back to you through a computer in case you lose them or want to store them.\n⬛ Catch Roll The main use of Pokéballs is catching Pokémon, they all have a seal you need to roll for the catch to be a success:\nItemSeal Potency\rPokeball 4 dice\rGreatball 6 dice\rUltraball 8 dice\r\rInflicting damage or a Status Ailments will modify your Catch Roll. These Bonuses Stack with each other, giving you up to +3 extra successes to your Catch Roll. You lose ALL Bonus Successes against a Fainted Pokémon.\nWild Pokémon's ConditionBonus Successes\rPokémon is at half HP 1\rPokémon is at 1 HP 1\rPokémon has a Status Ailment 1\r\rStronger Pokémon are harder to catch, this is why you must score a number of successes that varies with their Rank:\nPokémon's RankRequired Successes\rStarter3\rBeginner4\rAmateur6\rAce8\rProfessional9\r\rIf you don\u0026rsquo;t score the Required Successes, the Pokémon breaks free and the Pokéball is rendered unusable. Leslie found a wild Clefairy!\nAfter a fierce battle, she damaged Clefairy down to half its maximum HP. It is time to use a Pokéball!\nShe throws the Pokéball and rolls:\n{@icon dice|m|4} Pokéball\u0026rsquo;s Dicepool\n+ 1 Success (Clefairy’s at Half HP)\nCatch Roll: {@icon rdice|s|4}{@icon rdice|s|5}{@icon rdice|s|2}{@icon rdice|s|1}\nLeslie scored 3 success. Since this Clefairy\u0026rsquo;s Ranking is at Starter. That means\u0026hellip;\nLeslie caught a wild Clefairy!\n Inflicting damage on a Pokémon will reduce its Happiness and Loyalty; don\u0026rsquo;t expect a Pokémon you just beat into a pulp to be a happy and compliant partner.\nOther Pokémon take pride in proving themselves and handle their defeat against you gracefully.\nYou may also try and convince a Pokémon to come into adventures with you, no harm in trying.\nA friendly approach may win you their loyalty, although some Pokémon are picky as to whom they allow to train them.\nPokémon with a higher Rank than a Trainer won\u0026rsquo;t obey commands and cannot be a part of Training Sessions. If they were caught forcefully, they may even try to escape! If a recently captured Pokémon dislikes you, try to be understanding and compensate for it.\nBuilding a relationship with your Pokémon is one of the main aspects for this game.\n⬛ Special Pokéballs Decades ago, to obtain a Pokéball you had to search for a special kind of fruit called Apricorn and craft the item yourself. It was a long and arduous process that took several days. Back then, you REALLY had to work hard to catch a Pokémon.\nNowdays the Pokéball industry is constantly innovating and offering a variety of products for the diligent Trainer.\nThese Pokéballs have special effects on the Pokémon you catch with them or offer specialization when catching Pokémon that meet certain criteria.\nThey are limited editions and are usually not found on sale, but when they are, they are not cheap.\n{@icon ball|m|premier}\rPremier Ball\rThese are a sign of status, other trainers might respect you more if you use them.\r\r\r{@icon ball|m|luxury}\rLuxury Ball\rMoney CAN buy Pokémon happiness; the trait will improve if you catch them with this ball. \r\r{@icon ball|m|cherish}\rCherish Ball\rThis Ball is only handed to those who have ties or work directly in the League.\r\r\r{@icon ball|m|ub}\rUB-Ball\rA ball specially designed by the Aether foundation for their UB-Project.\r\r\r{@icon ball|m|dynamax}\rDynamax- Ball\rGalar scientist's pride, this virtual pokeball can create giant holograms that feel real.\r\r\r{@icon ball|m|master}\rMaster Ball\rSilph co. star project, rumor has it that it's capable of catching ANY Pokémon without fail.\r\r\rThere\u0026rsquo;s is a large variety of Pokéballs, finding all of them and their effects is one of the aspects of Pokémon catching. If you manage to learn how to craft your own Pokéballs you\u0026rsquo;ll gain an edge over other Trainers and save lots of money.\nOther ways to obtain Pokémon ⬛ Buying Pokémon Pokémon Breeding is a respected profession where people dedicate their lives to raise and nurture Pokémon that aid humans in their activities. Many of these professionally bred Pokémon can be bought, ensuring certain traits such as a non-aggressive nature, a good disposition for work, and even special moves.\nBuying Pokémon is a luxury, though. Their cost range from tens of thousands to even millions of pokédollars. Especially if the bred Pokémon is rare to find in the wild or hard to tame. You can also find common Pokémon for sale for a few hundred pokédollars in less reputable places, but it is up to you to trust this kind of establishments.\n⬛ Adopting Pokémon All around the world, there are abandoned Pokémon. Most of the time they are abandoned for being weak, rebellious or afraid of battles. Whatever the case these Pokémon need to be to taken care of.\nSome shelters located outside the cities look after them until another trainer wants to adopt them. Abandoned Pokémon have their own story to tell and many are wary of humans. If you give them respect and good care they may become your most loyal companions.\nAdopting is free for all registered trainers.\nIf you see a shelter, take a look inside, perhaps you’ll find the Pokémon you were looking for.\nAdopting a Pokémon is a good way to start your Adventure. However, many times they do not have the best attitude or an easy Nature.\r ⬛ Trading Pokémon Sometimes a Pokémon was not what you were expecting. Maybe you have too many Pokémon of the same species or maybe you want to get rid of a bad pet.\nInstead of abandoning them, why don’t you trade them? There are lots of trainers traveling from one city to another looking for a new Pokémon.\nIf you find someone willing to trade you one Pokémon in exchange for another, head to the nearest Pokémon center, put your pokéballs on the machine and wait for the process to complete.\nThe chip on your Pokémon will still name you as their original trainer but they will be now on the property of another trainer.\nBe careful as Pokémon you trade will take more time to adjust to their new trainer. Whenever you trade a Pokémon it will lose 1 point of Happiness and Loyalty, even if it is your original Pokémon you’re getting back.\n⬛ Releasing Pokémon There are times when there is no other option, your Pokémon is not happy living with humans or you find that your time together has come to an end.\nYou can simply let your Pokémon out of its Pokéball on its new home and leave it there, within a few weeks of not being recalled and not being close to its Pokéball the chip on your Pokémon will deactivate and another trainer will be able to catch it. Another way is going to a computer and manually deactivate the chip and ID of your Pokémon, then allow the machine to transport and release it on a secure location.\nIt is always sad to see a companion go, and abandoning a Pokémon for shallow reasons is frowned upon in the Pokémon League community.\nPokémon are sensitive creatures and abandonment takes a toll on their emotions and ability to trust humans.\nBe a responsible Trainer and don’t capture Pokémon you don’t intend to take care properly. Make sure you only release a Pokémon that wants to be released.\n","description":"","id":24,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"收服寶可夢","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/catching-pokemon/"},{"content":"擲骰判定 我們的生活無時無刻都會受到隨機因素的影響。運氣是我們生活中的一部分，它可以改變我們的未來，而命運也建立在我們的行動結果之上。\n在本系統中，所有的變數都會以六面骰來表示。 這種骰子很容易取得，且你可以在幾乎所有的桌遊店、或甚至在你的舊桌遊裡找到它們！\n在故事進行的過程中，你的角色將不得不採取一些不同尋常的行動。\n你需要擲骰判定來執行任何你所想像的動作。\n既然你已經瞭解了關於特質和技能的一切，接下來就是時候學習如何使用它們了。\n除了簡單的行為之外，所有的行動擲骰都會是一個特質和一個技能的組合。 把你的角色的這兩項數值加總起來，就會是你用來為該行動擲骰的最終骰池數量。\n拿這個骰池裡的骰子來擲骰，每顆骰出 4、 5、或 6的骰子將被視作一個成功骰。\n你可能會需要　1、 2、 3個或更多的成功骰才能讓這次擲骰判定成功，你所需的成功骰數將取決於任務的難度。\n\r 所需成功骰數  難度設定 \r 1 麻煩. 你很少會做這樣的事情。 \r 2 有挑戰性. 你在執行時會遭遇不少阻礙。 \r 3 困難. 這個情境陷你於巨大的劣勢之中。 \r 4 瘋狂. 僅僅嘗試去這麼做的想法都顯得無比荒謬。 \r 5+ 幾乎不可能. 一切邏輯推論都表明這個行為是不可能的任務。 \r\r威爾遜正在追逐著一隻把他訓練家背包的黑暗鴉。\n因為背包的重量，黑暗鴉的飛行速度被拖慢，也飛不了太高，因此要追上牠並不困難，威爾遜的擲骰判定只需要有 1 顆成功骰就能逮到這個小賊。\n在當天稍晚，一隻烏鴉頭頭飛來，並偷走了他的包包（又來了！）。因為烏鴉頭頭比較強壯，牠的速度不會被拖慢，所以威爾遜要追上牠將會需要 3 顆成功骰。\n如果威爾遜沒能在第一次擲骰就捉到牠，那麼烏鴉頭頭就會飛得更高，讓擲骰判定的難度變得越來越困難，直到牠飛到搆不著的高空，徹底遠走高飛。\n ⬛ 大失敗 如果你讓一個四歲孩子在緊急情況下駕駛飛機迫降會發生什麼事？對，大概不會有什麼好下場。\n在嘗試進行高難度任務時做出糟糕的表現可能會帶來災難性的後果。這就是為什麼當你在擲骰時得到了比要求成功骰數低 3 顆或以下的成功骰時，你不僅無法完成任務．說書人還可能斟酌讓一些不好的事情發生。你可能會：\n 受到傷害 誤傷到隊友 使任務完全不可能達成 陷入異常狀態\n……或其他更糟的。  這意味著，你可以安全地嘗試進行難度為 「麻煩」 或是 「有挑戰性」 的任務，然而一旦難度提升到 「困難」 或以上，那麼你因為失誤而負傷或造成災難性後果的可能性也就浮上了水面。\n你骰出的結果跟所需成功骰數差的越遠，你導致的後果就可能會越糟糕。\n","description":"說明擲骰判定的相關規則","id":25,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"擲骰判定","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/starting-the-game/rolling-dice/"},{"content":"Training Pokemon Training Sessions Pokémon training is probably the most fundamental aspect of becoming stronger.\nA training session usually takes 2 hours of your day within the game. During this time you work with your Pokémon, you try to understand their ways, their motives, their strengths and weaknesses. Before attempting to teach them something new, you have to bond with them, especially if they are newly caught. This way you can raise their Loyalty and Happiness.\nOnce everything is said and done, present your Pokémon with simple and entertaining physical and mental activities like games, puzzles, item gathering, weight lifting, etc. You can get as creative as you want, just remember that some Pokémon may require special attention.\nTraining a Pokémon requires patience and lots of work. You will need to get better in your own skills if you want to be a better Pokémon Trainer.\nYou may teach a Pokémon by using your different skills.\nOnce you are ready, you can choose how to strengthen your Pokémon.\nTom has been working with his team, a Jigglypuff, a Lillipup and newly caught Oddish and wants to increase their speed, so he’s staring a routine where all his Pokémon run laps.\nWeeks later, Oddish has evolved and in preparation for it to evolve again it will need lots of sunlight and nourishment, Tom knows about gardening and goes to a store to buy some fertilizer to treat Gloom with it.\nThere are many ways to Train a Pokémon, it just needs a little bit of imagination!\n ⬛ Rank Up The most essential job of a Trainer is to raise powerful and happy Pokémon. Your Starter will be the same Rank as you when you start the game, but once you increase your Rank, you will have to Rank-Up all Pokémon you have. Some wild Pokémon might seem weak but with you as a Trainer they will become champion material in no time!\nDepending on the technique used to train a Pokémon,\nRoll an Attribute/Social Attribute + Lore\nafter a Training Session.\nOnce you score the required successes, the Pokémon Rank is raised by one level (ex. from Beginner to Amateur).\nRankRequired Successes\rto Beginner 3 \rto Amateur 6 \rto Ace 12 \rto Pro 24 \rto Master 36 \rto Champion 48 \r\rYou cannot raise a Pokémon’s Rank beyond your own, and Training Rolls are done only once per day.\nTo fully Rank Up a Pokémon, you need several days.\n⬛ Retrain Most Trainers won’t get it right on the first try. Considering there are hundreds of different species, whatever works for a Pokémon might not work for another, so, it is possible for a Trainer to rethink their strategy and retrain a companion. Doing so it’s a lot easier than Ranking Up a newly caught Pokémon.\nYou may use the Training Session to Retrain instead of Ranking Up. If so, simply:\nRoll an Attribute/Social Attribute + Lore\nafter a Training Session.\nOnce you score 3 Successes, you get several benefits:\n Redistribute all Attributes and Social Attributes awarded by Rank. Redistribute all Skill Points awarded by Rank. Assign all Skill Points from a Rank, before assigning all Skill Points from the next Rank. Pokémon may forget Moves and learn new Moves from available Ranks. Forgotten Moves exclusive to previous Evolutions are lost forever.  Remember, Training Rolls are done only once per day.\n⬛ Training a Disobedient Pokémon You cannot train a Pokémon of higher Rank than your own. Perhaps the disobedient Pokémon simply wants to do things its own way or maybe it’s is not paying attention deliberately. For whatever reason, you haven’t earned its respect.\nChristine is just a Beginner but has two Pokémon on her team, her starter Pidgey, and a recently caught Persian.\nThey are gathered for a group Training Session.\nThe trio begins by playing Dodgeball. But during today’s game only Pidgey followed Christine’s commands. When Christine threw the ball, Persian quickly crushed it with its fangs and went away to sleep under a tree.\nThis Persian’s Rank is Amateur.This means Christine’s skill is simply not enough to handle this Pokémon.\nPersian won’t be obeying orders anytime soon.\n Evolve your Pokémon Evolving a Pokémon is hard work, it requires hours and hours of Training or years of struggle, but when it finally happens, your companions will get a lot stronger.\nThe amount of training required to Evolve a Pokémon varies from species to species. Bug-Type Pokémon tend to Evolve quickly, while Dragon Pokémon take ages.\nPokémon may evolve for several reasons, some Evolve to survive in a hostile environment, others Evolve thanks to age and experience, others change when subjected to materials or energies. See a Pokémon’s Entry for details.\n⬛ Evolve through Battle Experience Most Pokémon evolve after battling quite a lot. If you’re interested on getting your companions to their Final Form, pay attention to their Battles and their ability to win.\nOnce a Pokémon has met the required number of Victories, it will begin its transformation.\nEach species evolves at different rates, described as Evolution Time. Follow this simple chart:\nEvolution TimeRequired Victories\rFast 5 \rMedium 15 \rSlow 45 \r\rNewly caught Pokémon may already have some Victories under their belt.\nWhen a Pokémon Evolves, use their New Pokédex Entry as a Template and distribute all bonuses from Rank just as you would when Retraining. ⬛ Overranking When a Pokémon is ready to Evolve, you may choose to stop the Evolution by making it snap out of the trance. If you do, a Pokémon retains some of the power it tapped from the process.\nThe Pokémon gains access to 1 Move from a Rank higher than its own! This means an Amateur Ranked Pokémon may have 1 Move from Ace Rank.\nThere is a problem, though, a Pokémon resets the Victory count to zero, so, if it wants to Evolve, it must start all over again. Also, a Pokémon may not have more than one Overranked Move at a time.\nFinal Forms may benefit from Overranking too, once they achieve 20 Victories, they get access to one and only one Move from a Higher Rank.\n⬛ The Limits of a Pokémon Pokémon bodies are quite different to human bodies, therefore, they have different capabilities too. Some can be stronger, faster, or sturdier. To reach the full capacity of development on the body is what we call: Limits.\nA human has a Limit of 5 points in all attributes, that means that when you reach 5 points, you have developed the attribute maximum for a human.\nThe Pokémon’s Limits are different for each species and tend to increase with evolution.\nEven if a Pokémon’s Limit may not seem very high, remember that all Pokémon posses an attribute that no human has: Special. This, alongside the moves they can learn is what allows them to do incredible feats that humans will never be able to.\nIf we compare the difference of Limits in Strength of a human and a Tyrogue, we would have:\n Human’s Strength: ●●○○○ Tyrogue’s Strength: ●○○  This means that even if Tyrogue reached its full Limit in Strength, it would not be stronger than a very fit human with 4 or more points in that attribute.\nBut if that same Tyrogue evolves into a Hitmonlee, the Strength limit compared to a human would be:\n Human’s Strength: ●●○○○ Hitmonlee’s Strength: ●●●○○○○  Tyrogue’s Evolution obtains a potential that not even the strongest human could ever match.\n ⬛ Teaching New Moves, Forgetting old ones. Pokémon are able to learn incredibly good Moves, train hard and show them the real arsenal at their disposal.\nWhen you Retrain a Pokémon it is able able to forget a Move they already know to try out something new. When your Pokémon forgets a Move you may pick a new Move from your Rank or lower.\nHowever, if your Pokémon forgets a Move exclusive to its previous Evolution, it will NOT be able to get it back.\nRemember that your Pokémon has a limit of Moves it can learn equal to: Insight + 2.\n⬛ Move Tutors Some people are even capable of teaching moves that are not usually known by some species. They are called Move Tutors.\nThese amazing trainers are retired fighters, mystic people or great elders from far away lands. Their secrets are kept away from strangers, but sometimes they take Pokémon as pupils to teach them their ancient techniques.\nShould you meet one of them, show respect and maybe they’ll teach you in exchange for a favor.\n⬛ Day-Care Centers There are establishments that give care and training to Pokémon when their owners are too busy or simply do not have the skills necessary to raise a Pokémon. Think about them as obedience schools for pets in the real world.\nThey’ll raise and discipline your Pokémon, charging you for every day it stays in their facilities. In the Day-Care, your Pokémon will be fed, bathed, socialized and educated. When you get it back, the number of Required Victories to Evolve may be reduced at the Storyteller’s discretion.\nRemember that a well-behaved Pokémon is not always equal to a happy or loyal Pokémon.\n","description":"","id":26,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"訓練寶可夢","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/training-pokemon/"},{"content":"階級

終於，你成功擊敗了冠軍，現在你擁有著訓練家所能取得的最高頭銜。你的名聲傳遍了所有的國界與聯盟，你寶可夢的本領也超越了牠們物種天生的能力與技藝。參見第459頁「前路挑戰」章節。\n晉升這個階級需要達成什麼成就？  在聯盟賽的挑戰中擊敗冠軍。  好處:  總共 14 點可供分配的特質點數。 寶可夢的特質可以被增加到最高比上限高 2 點。 額外獲得 1 點技能點數。  \r整體而言，階級代表著投入特定生活方式的時間與精力，而在這裡，所謂的特定生活方式便是指「寶可夢訓練」。\n野生的寶可夢也擁有階級，且也能從中獲得相應的好處。野生寶可夢的階級將由說書人自行决定。\n寶可夢不會聽從階級低於自己的訓練家的命令。 因此，如果你捕捉到或透過交易從他人手中獲得了一隻階級比你高的寶可夢，牠的階級會維持原樣，讓你幾乎不可能控制或者讓牠服從於你。\n寶可夢聯盟並不看好那些無法在正式比賽中控制自己寶可夢的訓練家。\n在錦標賽或正式比賽中無法控制自己寶可夢的訓練家將會被取消資格。\n你將會需要提升自己做為訓練家的能力，才能夠完全馴服這些更強大的寶可夢，並釋放出牠們真正的潛力。\n好消息是，如果你捕捉或獲得的寶可夢階級比你還要低，那麼在經過一段期間的訓練之後，牠們將會自動提升到與你相符的階級。\n由於你的階級反映出了你訓練寶可夢的精通程度，你也同時知曉如何讓寶可夢發揮出牠們最好的能力，因此現在你能夠更有效率地讓牠們達到這個階級了。\n","description":"說明訓練家階級的意義和效果","id":28,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"階級","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/starting-the-game/ranking/"},{"content":"創作故事 現在是時候用一點轟轟烈烈的爆炸讓命運的列車脫軌了！角色們期待著遭遇生活中的冒險，而當他們出發去找麻煩時，他們將發現你早已準備就緒。\n擔任說書人並創作故事其實沒有大家想像中的那麼困難。放輕鬆，盡情享受那些瘋狂點子帶來的樂趣。只要記住，你在這裡是為了確保大家都能玩得開心。\n首先，和你的玩家們討論，詢問他們希望玩些什麼？他們對故事有什麼樣的期待？以及他們對於寶可夢世界有什麼樣看法。\n你需要統整他們的看法，確保他們對於這個社會的運作有一個清晰的認知，對角色看待寶可夢和其他人們的態度能有所共識，從而扮演出活生生的角色。你可以在最後為此做一個簡單總結，確保大家都站在同一條線上。\n仔細傾聽玩家關注的事物，也適時表達自己的意見。\n記得，他們也有責任創造出有趣且能為故事做出貢獻的角色。\n那些與其他玩家或說書人作對的人，就是沒有正確履行身為玩家所應盡的職責。\n確保沒有任何玩家創造了無法與他人結交朋友的角色。\n一旦大家都達成了共識，就可以準備開始了。\n冒險故事的點子 寶可夢之旅 類型: 探索\n焦點: 寶可夢傳說\n遊戲規劃: 設計玩家周圍的地理興趣點。\n安排NPC: 每個NPC可以是當地人、或是與這個興趣點之間有著個人關連的其他訓練家。\n設置阻礙: 每個阻礙可能只能透過利用特定的寶可夢或特定招式來通過。\n\r任務 類型: 動作\n焦點: 寶可夢對戰\n遊戲規劃: 設計一個正在傷害玩家、寶可夢、環境或是人民的反派。\n安排敵人: 每個敵人都應該帶有一隻或更多的寶可夢，準備好阻撓隊伍的前進。\n\r陰謀 類型: 調查\n焦點: 人類角色\n遊戲規劃: 設計一個反派和一個邪惡計畫。\n設置線索: 其中一條線索需要透過戰鬥技能來獲得，另一條則可能要使用社交技能；其他的線索則可能得透過生存技能、或者利用知識技能才能取得。所有的線索都應該圍繞著一個即將發生的危險。\n\r遊戲時間的長度 一場遊戲聚會的時間通常會持續 2 ~ 4 個小時。\n考慮到在這個時間段內，玩家們通常只能完成 2 ~ 3 個過程被詳細描述的目標，並仍保有一些發展角色的扮演空間。戰鬥永遠不會是必要的；正常人不需要每天都為自己的小命奮戰，但他們仍然會遭遇各種麻煩、緊張、和危急的時刻。戰鬥最好被用作緊張嚴峻情境、或一連串壞決定所導致的劇情高潮。\n這個遊戲的重點是精彩的故事劇情，而不是惱人的戰鬥練等。\n講述故事的多種方式 取決於玩家們的目標不同，總是會有辦法讓講述故事的過程變得更加輕鬆。\n這個遊戲有三種主要的說故事方式：\n編年史 有些故事太長，沒有辦法在一次遊戲聚會的時間內說完。編年史是一部有著主線劇情，且通常會有反派反覆出現的宏大冒險故事。這種類型的故事可以營造出相當史詩的壯闊感，並會花上好幾個月的遊戲時間。\n人們普遍認為這樣的敘事方式是角色扮演遊戲的正常模式，但事實並非如此。\n這其實是困難模式。\n經常能看到有人興致勃勃地以編年史體裁開始了遊戲，但始終無法將故事完成，所以盡可能保持簡單吧。\n玩家們與說書人之間的溝通尤其重要。\n\r單元劇 想像成像是電視劇那樣，每一次的遊戲聚會本身就是一場完整的冒險故事。\n許多事物都可能因此產生或好或壞的變化，但記住，讓它們帶來有力的影響。讓玩家們能夠從中學到新東西。他們能在冒險之後回到正常生活的事實，並不意味著他們得空手而歸。\n你可以先用單元劇的方式開始遊戲，接著再拋出一些編年史的要素。\n\r環團 多虧了許多人一起輪流講述故事的性質，環團是一個有著很大優勢的敘事方式。\n因為每個說書人都會帶來他們各自的獨特想法，角色們將能夠因此獲得更多不同種類的冒險體驗。\n除此之外，說書人們也能夠在輪到別人時休息一下，能夠扮演遊玩他們自己的角色，也會有更多的時間能夠醞釀，寫出更好的冒險故事。\n這就像是在觀賞一系列的電影，講述著角色們的來來往往。這與一般的編年史相當類似，但同時也結合了單元劇的敘事方式。\n\r所有玩家都應該…… 順其自然 維持進入角色的狀態並積極扮演，不要說：「我派出我的龍系寶可夢，然後我命令牠攻擊之類的……」，而是如同你的角色真實存在於那個情境去進行扮演，像是說：「去吧，烈咬陸鯊！使用龍之俯衝衝過去！」 不要害羞！一起享受扮演的樂趣吧！\n保持專注 有時候當故事裡並沒有發生什麼大事，或也許你的角色並不在當前場景之中。你仍需要靜下心，認真傾聽，並且保持專心。在說書人說話的時候注意聆聽是一種常規的禮貌。這同時也能讓整個遊戲進行的更快速、更流暢。\n做為一個團隊 其他的玩家也都是你們團隊的一員，你應該要和他們、以及他們的角色友好相處。你們是一個團隊，且應該要以一個團隊該有的樣子共同合作。為了自己的快樂而與其他玩家作對，是一種破壞性且不尊重他人的行為。千萬別成為那種人。\n追求目標 你想要贏過道館館主嗎？還是想要探索充滿新奇寶可夢的古老遺跡？創造出能配合這個目標的角色。如果你因為某些原因茫然不知所措，你可以詢問說書人複述一下重要的劇情重點。\n不要糾結於規則和機制 記住，說書人將會決定什麼在故事中才是合適的。如果不幸發生了衝突或僵局時，請使用常識，且將故事優先於其他的一切。\n試著講述故事！ 每個人都具有說故事的能力，我們也鼓勵你時不時就去嘗試看看。\n做為說書人講述冒險故事是一種相當美妙的體驗，而且絕對比你想像的要容易得多。\n我們相信你一定做得到！\n說故事的原則 1. 不要為了贏而創造故事 這並不是一款讓你擊敗玩家的遊戲。\n2. 不要為微不足道的細節煩惱 你的職責是創造出一個情境、一個氛圍。你不需要去描述每一個物件被放在哪裡。讓玩家們的想像力自行發揮，這能大大節省時間，也不會讓遊戲因此被干擾。\n3. 幫助玩家們進入他們的角色 玩家們畢竟不是真的進入了寶可夢的世界。別期望玩家會照著你想像的樣子去扮演。試著跟他們提醒他們的角色可能會有的感受和想法。時不時提供一些想法給他們能帶來很大的幫助。\n4. 這遊戲並不只有機制 這是一款關於角色扮演的遊戲，所以不需要太深究於數字、規則、和突發戰鬥。這些永遠都不比故事劇情來得重要。\n5. 積極角色扮演 這個遊戲要求你們積極地進行角色扮演。你不僅要為講述故事做準備，也得準備好扮演角色。這也同樣適用於玩家。\n透過描述自己的角色和寶可夢在遊戲中採取的行動和招式，為遊戲增添風味。\n6. 善用工具 就算你有美妙的嗓音，你也可以借助一些音樂和音效的幫助。你可以把地圖列印出來，或讓玩家們看看他們所在地的圖片。這能幫助大家建立共識，也能讓你的故事更加有趣。\n7. 做好準備 帶著空空的腦袋走進房間裡可不怎麼OK。\n即興演出只能幫你到這了。\n8. 利用時間 讓時間成為你的幫手。你可以使用倒敘、快轉的手法推進故事，或者在你需要一些時間思考的時候暫停團務。稍作休息總是好的。\n9. 確保每個人都玩得開心 你不是他們的娛樂演員，但你必須確保每個人都參與到故事之中：無論是最健談外向的玩家、或最害羞膽小的玩家，都能夠從故事中得到樂趣。\n10. 盡可能簡要的開場 長篇大論的介紹相當無聊。就算之前發生過什麼非常重要的事件，也請試著簡明扼要的說明。\n11. 讓人感覺真實，而非「寫實」 要讓你的冒險故事栩栩如生，你就必須享受遊戲中純真和幻想。\n12. 再強調一次，不要為了贏而創作故事 只是再強調一下。\n13. 說書人並不是「上帝」 你在遊戲中永遠握有最終的裁斷權，但千萬不要讓權力蒙蔽你。若你以為你可以為所欲為，你很快就會發現自己找不到願意與你一起玩的玩家了。\n 說故事的小技巧 即興發揮 有時你的玩家們會提出一些瘋狂或不合邏輯的建議。當他們這麼做時，盡量不要說「不」，因為他們肯定是覺得這麼做有它的樂趣在。順其自然，即興發揮，並嘗試將它融入情境與故事之中。\n準備隨機遭遇 有時候玩家們會走到某個出乎你預料到的地方，因此隨時準備好一些壞蛋和他們的寶可夢。\n這只應該用在你真正需要它們的時候，而不是做為你故事中必然發生的片段。如果你沒有在這次的聚會中用到這些遭遇，那就把它們留待之後再使用。\n給出緊急線索 玩家們常常會不小心錯過某個非常關鍵的線索。也許這條線索曾經擺在他們的眼皮底下，但現在沒有了它，玩家們因此難有進展，或者故事將因此發生一個痛苦的轉折。\n在這種狀況下，你可能必須讓這個線索在必要時出現在另外一個地方。也許是時候使用你準備好的隨機遭遇，或者讓他們的盟友現身了。\n優先考慮故事的流程，而不是謎題和機制。\n提供正面回饋 也許玩家們的角色扮演開始超遊、或出現了破壞性。不要緊張，保持冷靜，跟他們好好談談。\n不要因為遊戲外發生的事情而在遊戲中懲罰你的玩家。讓他們參與進來，給他們目標，並獎勵他們的成就。你也可以試著把他們在遊戲外做出的互動與言行轉換到遊戲內。結果可能會讓你大吃一驚。\n","description":"說明該如何創作出精彩的冒險故事","id":29,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"創作故事","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/starting-the-game/create-story/"},{"content":"Pokedex There are almost a thousand known species of Pokémon in the world, some better known than others.\nIn this section of the book you’ll find all the information available about most of them.\nTo create and train your Pokémon you’ll need to check its Pokédex entry, Ability and Moves in the Pokémon Abilities and Pokémon Moves sections of this book.\nNow, this might seem like a lot of information to take in. How will you ever memorize all these names, data, Moves and special Abilities?\nDon’t worry! You don’t have to memorize it at all! Simply take this information to customize your Pokémon and build a unique character.\nThink of your Pokémon as an extension of your Trainer’s abilities. Pokémon work like powers at your disposition. If you want Ice powers you should capture an Ice Pokémon. If you want to be a bard, get a Pokémon with Sing.\r Your Pokémon are capable of working wonders with ease. They have many abilities and maybe a dozen moves to learn. Focus only on what you want.\nThink about it this way: You have 6 slots available for customization.\nEach and every Pokémon you carry will have a special role in your party. You can complement your team any way you want.\nPerhaps you want a bulky Pokémon that can take a hit or a fast companion to sweep an enemy party, a cute kitten who’s only there to charm the girls or a passionate mouse to cheer everyone’s fighting spirit.\nYour imagination is the limit.\n\rUse the tools on this book and your imagination to create unique Pokémon. They are part of a living world, take your time and describe their behaviors.\r\nKeep in mind that a Pokémon’s uniqueness is not in its Strength or its high Attributes, but in the role playing you get from your players thanks to it.\r\nForm Variations A few Pokémon have different looks even when they are the same species. Sometimes this change is merely aesthetic, other times they evolve into a variant and cannot change back. And other times a certain move or item triggers these changes.\nSome of these variants can only be found in certain parts of the world. The different forms may change their attribute Limit distribution, grant them a new power and/or change their Type.\nFor Mega-Evolution your trainer will have to meet certain conditions for the form to be stable and long-lasting.\nMake sure to read all the entries on the different Form Variations of these Pokémon.\nShould one of your Pokémon change forms, during the game, it is convenient to have the character sheets of all its Form variations.\nEach Form would have its own set of Attributes and points on them according to your Rank, even if they are different from each other.\nYou may use your own discretion as to what triggers the changes on certain Pokémon. It may be an Item, energy or perhaps they are able to change at will.\r A Note on World Building This world is vast and extense with many regions to explore. It is very easy to get carried away, wanting to start really big, however, we recommend you start small.\nStart in a town or a Small city, let the world expand in the direction your players want to explore rather than putting them on a big world map with no direction on where to start.\nIn the end they can end up going through every city, just not in the “expected” order, or even travel through regions, changing leagues, skipping gyms, or even end up in a completely made up place.\nYou will notice this method will develop a much more organic adventure than trying to railroad a party through a map of cities, going from point A to point B each time an objective is “cleared”.\nThis is also beneficial for the Storyteller as you won’t have to prepare a grand set of chained events unfolding all through the region, but simply prepare the small sections the players will be exploring for the day.\n A Note on Breeding Pokémon When two Pokémon love each other very very much they’ll spend some time together and then a Pokémon Egg will appear. This is not just a tale that the adults tell children; no one really knows how these eggs pop into existence. It is one of the many mysteries in the world of Pokémon.\nBaby Pokémon need a lot of nurturing and love to grow happy and strong. All Pokémon can fall in love with each other, regardless of their species. The baby will often come out as the First-stage species of the mother.\nDue to parents not always being of the same species, Baby Pokémon may show traits that their species doesn’t normally have thanks to having a parent with a different set of powers.\nThis isn’t a game to get endless Pokémon eggs in search for the perfect offspring, should players get their hands on a Pokémon egg, remember to give it the importance it deserves, it’s not just time and heat what will make it hatch, it is through love and kindness that the baby Pokémon will come out.\nIt may take a few weeks or a few months but when the shell begins to crack it’ll be a big moment of happiness!\nBe ready to change diapers and bottle-feed your new bundle of joy.\n If you want to try out breeding Pokémon head to your nearest day-care center.\r A Note on Ecosystems What you just saw is only the first part of a great variety of creatures, how many of them you’ll end up seeing? It’s up to you!\nThis world has many ecosystems which you can fill with whatever number of creatures you want to bring it closer to life, with almost a thousand Pokémon to choose from.\nAdding variety to the creatures you encounter will increase the sense of wonder and discovery.\n Pokedex list see here.\n","description":"","id":30,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"寶可夢圖鑑","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/pokedex/"},{"content":"Frequently Asked Questions Can I Target an Ally with a Move that Targets a Foe? Yes, you can. Very rarely you’ll find a use to it, but sometimes it’s worth the effort, such as with Swagger or an Electric Move on a Pokémon with Volt Absorb.\nCan my Pokémon Target itself with a Move that Targets an Ally or a Foe? No, you can’t. Most Moves that target an Ally or a Foe are just impossible to be employed on the User, such as After You or Helping Hand, you need another target to benefit from this power. Now, if you’re talking about hitting your own Pokémon with its own attack, don’t expect your Pokemon to comply.\nWhat’s the meaning of “Out of Range”? Some moves like Fly or Dig take the Pokémon out of range of the fight. When a Pokémon is out of range, it is unaffected by attacks and Moves of any kind. As always, there may be exceptions depending on the situation.\nIf my Pokémon moves away during its turn, is it still in range of the foe? Yes. Fight’s are not static, people and Pokémon don’t stay rooted the whole scene exchanging blows until someone falls unconscious. Pokémon Battles are dynamic, everyone is constantly moving even if they’re not explicitly saying so. If you decide to run away, the Battle may end.\nMy Pokémon is able to float/fly is it still affected by Ground-Type Moves? If your Pokémon is not Flying-Type or harthe ability Levitate, or any other stated immunity to Ground, it will be affected.\nWhat’s the meaning of “Ready to Fight”? When a Pokémon switches in it cannot act until it stays Begining of the next Round.\nAt that time, the Pokémon is finally “Ready to Fight” and it can act normally.\nCan Protect/Detect/Wide Guard and the like stack with each other? No.\nSome Moves are labeled as “Switcher Moves” this allows the next Pokémon you send to switch in “Ready to Fight”.\nIf my Pokémon fainted, will my next Pokémon be “Ready to Fight”? Yes. When your Pokémon faints your turn is over. You may send your next Pokémon at the Beginning of the next Round and it will be Ready to Fight.\nIf my Pokémon moves away during its turn, is it still in range of the foe? Yes. Fight’s are not static, people and Pokémon don’t stay rooted the whole scene exchanging blows until someone falls unconscious. Pokémon Battles are dynamic, everyone is constantly moving even if they’re not explicitly saying so.\nI ordered my Pokémon to attack but the foe used a priority Move to attack me first, can I change the order into an Evasion? Yes. As long as your Pokémon wasn’t able to resolve its original action, you may order it to evade or even use another Priority Move.\nIs it possible to extend the duration of effects such as Rain Dance or Lucky Chant? Yes, at Storyteller’s discretion.\nCan I stack Attribute Increases on my Pokémon? Moves that increase the same Attribute won’t stack, but take the higher increase into account instead. They don’t stack with Items either, only with Abilities.\nCan I increase the Damage on Z-Moves, Max Moves and G-Max Moves? If you are of the appropiate Rank, you may. Take into account that each Damage Dice you increase will cost you an Effect.\nCan my Pokémon have Z-Moves, Max Moves and G-Max Moves at the same time? It is certainly possible, but it will be up to your Storyteller.\nIf I’m using Multiple Actions, how many successes do I need to Evade or Clash an attack? You just need to score as many successes as your foe, it doesn’t matter if it’s your first, second or fifth action. However, your next action WILL require an additional success, as Evading and Clashing do count as an Action.\nIs it possible to Evade more than once per Round? Only by using Double Team, Minimize or similar Moves.\nCan I use the Move Dig to escape from a building or a cave? Definetly. However, it may take some time depending on the terrain.\nUse common sense.\n","description":"","id":31,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"常見問題","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/pokemon-moves/faq/"},{"content":"Pokemon Abilities Along with their amazing powers, Pokémon are born with special Abilities that define their species. These Abilities may affect their personality and skill sets, and give them advantages in-and-out of battle.\nAlways consider the Ability of your Pokémon to aid you in any situation.\nSometimes Pokémon have more than one ability to choose from, outside of battle they can be used at will.\nAt the beginning of a battle, you must inform your storyteller which Ability your Pokemon will use.\nIt cannot be changed once the battle has started.\nWild Pokémon will always use the Ability that benefits them most in-battle, and the one that’s most useful for their survival out of it.\nEffects on Abilities do stack with effects on Moves, such as increasing or reducing attributes, but they rarely stack with each other, meaning that if two Pokémon have the same Ability only one will have effect.\nA Pokémon can make use of an Ability that is not listed on their Pokédex entry at storyteller’s discretion.\nRemember to check on important notes at the end of this section.\nForm-altering Abilities Certain Abilities will allow Pokémon to change between forms. When this happens it means only that Pokémon can make use of that Ability unless there is a convincing explanation as to how another Pokémon would alter their form to match the Ability’s effects.\nIt is convenient you have a character sheet for each of your Pokémon’s Forms.\nEach Form will have their Attribute points distriubted according to their rank but they do not necesarily have to match each other.\nIgnoring or Negating? When an Ability calls for Ignoring an effect, it means that only that Pokémon can act around the effect being ignored, but everything and everyone else will still be affected by it.\nWhen an Ability calls for negating an effect, it means thet the Pokémon who has their effects negated cannot access to their power due to external forces preventing it to do so.\nCurse Abilities Some effects of Moves or Abilities may require help from mediums to remove them. If such help is not available you can try to change it with another Move or Ability at your disposition. And if that doesn’t work, you can try to do it through sheer willpower or hoping the effects go away on their own after a few days\u0026hellip;\nThat can happen, right? right?!\nHidden Abilities Some Pokémon might have Abilities that are not listed on their Pokédex Entry.\nThese Hidden Abilities are the result of uncommon circumstances in a Pokémon’s life.\nIt’s up to the Storyteller to determine which Pokémon will obtain a certain Ability. Talk to him or her about how your Pokémon may obtain the Hidden Ability you want.\nKeep in mind that Pokémon with Abilities not usually seen on them are rare and will turn a few heads among Pokémon scholars.\n\nAbilities Lists see here.\n","description":"","id":32,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"寶可夢特性","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/pokemon-abilities/"},{"content":"Conclusion 10 Tips for Successful Battles 1. Train Your Pokémon. Through training you can try different builds of Attributes, Skills and Moves and find powerful combitations. If you want to be a strong Trainer you need strong Pokémon.\n2. Use your advantages. Not only Type advantages, consider what your Pokémon is good at and how you will exploit that in your favor.\n3. Use or create weaknesses. If the foe is too strong or fast, what will you use to counter it? Perhaps the foe is using a move with low Accuracy that can be evaded, and an attribute reduction will surely hinder its performance.\n4. Know your moves Learn the Power, Accuracy and effects of the moves you’ll be using regularly to get the most out of them.\n5. Evade, Clash and Cover Unless you are sure you’ll withstand the hit, evade, clash or take cover from attacks. Keep your damage intake per round as low as possible.\n6. Use Multiple Actions. Mastering multiple actions is a key to master Pokémon Battles. Bit by bit they help you gain an edge, increase your dice pools and get the most of them.\n7. Adapt to your opponent’s strategy. If you keep doing the same you’ll keep getting the same result. If something isn’t working, change your tactic or you\u0026rsquo;ll lose.\n8. Strike at the right time. Be patient, keep your cards in your hand. Don’t strike too early and risk to reveal them, don’t strike too late and miss your chance to do what you wanted.\n9. Be decisive Don’t make the battle drag on forever by taking too much time to decide what action you’ll take.\n10. Keep Trying. You and your Pokémon are a team, together you share victory and you share defeat. The road to success is built around failures.\nDon’t lose heart, and keep trying!\n As you can see, Pokémon battles are quite an exciting yet dangerous event.\nDon’t be disheartened if you lose a battle. Defeat is part of the road to success. Take one step at a time.\nAs a trainer, you’ll need to understand just how much you can ask from your Pokémon, and they will need your guidance to push their limits.\nThe secret to achieving a victory every time will be finding the right time to make your strikes.\nThere will be occasions in which you will need to endure a hit or two and you’ll have to choose which hits your Pokémon definitely needs to evade; other times you’ll have to risk everything in a single all-or-nothing attack. And when things can’t get any worse, you may need to spend some Will points and let fate decide.\nIt is a long way for a trainer to master all of the battle strategies, but having your friends beside you will make it a lot easier if you all learn from each other.\nIn any case, you’ll learn a lot more from experience, so go out there and live your own Pokémon battles!\nKeep the fights interesting by detailing the progression of the battle. Describe their actions and their effects, not only the damage spoints they take.\r ","description":"","id":33,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"總結","uri":"https://hazmole.github.io/PokeRole/docs/pokemon-battle/conclusion/"}]
